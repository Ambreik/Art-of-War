			Forged Document

	Description : A counterfeit permit, pass, or authorization scroll created using enchanted inks and outlaw craftsmanship. At a glance, it resembles an authentic 
piece of bureaucracy: stamped seals, signatures, and even the faint ink-press marks that mimic official parchment. These documents vary in type — merchant passes, 
travel permits, military orders, or noble decrees — but all share the same purpose: to grant access or privilege the player does not legally hold. While convincing 
to the casual eye, they always risk detection by suspicious guards, clerks, or magically warded checkpoints.

	Mechanics

- Type / Item Category : Ticket / Permit (Consumable).
- Use : Grants temporary access or authority within restricted zones (e.g., "Military Quarters", "Central Plaza", "Noble Estates", "Dockmaster Offices").
- Activation : Player “presents” the document at guard checkpoints, gates, or scripted interactions requiring proof of identity or permission.
- Duration : Lasts until either:
	1. Successfully inspected and detected as false.
	2. Destroyed manually by the player.
	3. Expires after 24 in-game hours (decay system).

- Inspection / Detection Chance :
	- Base chance of guard inspection per presentation: 15%.
	- If inspected, there is a 25% chance the forgery is exposed as fake.
	- Detection modifiers apply (see below).

- Modifiers :
	- Rank of Guard/NPC : High-rank or investigator NPCs increase detection chance (+30%).
	- Faction Territory : In Pindar strongholds, werewolf guards can smell the parchment chemicals, giving +10% detection chance.
	- Forgery Quality : Documents made with "Master-tier Ink of False Sigils" lower inspection risk (-10%).
	- Repetition : Using the same document multiple times raises suspicion (each use adds +5% inspection chance).

- Consequences if Exposed :
	- Immediate destruction of the document.
	- Player receives the "Criminal Charge" debuff.
	- If impersonating military or noble authority → bounty penalty doubled (stacking outlaw risk).
	- Guards attack on sight; bounty hunters or inquisitors may be dispatched.

	Acquisition / Usage

- Source : Forged through "Ink of False Sigils" by outlaw scribes or criminal NPCs.
- Vendors : Outlaw faction vendors in "Caerlis Keep" or black-market contacts in major capitals (reputation-locked).
- Drop : Rare loot from smuggler caches, outlaw scribes, or caravan raids.
- Mission Reward : Sometimes awarded during outlaw questlines (e.g., infiltration or sabotage missions).
- Limitations :
	- Cannot be created by ordinary professions; tied specifically to Outlaw Scribe craft.
	- Each document is unique to the zone or purpose (e.g., Military Pass won’t work at the Dock Office).
	- High-level magical or divine seals always detect forgeries (auto-fail at certain checkpoints).
