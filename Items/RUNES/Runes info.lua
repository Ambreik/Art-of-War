			Runes

Runes are learned by studying scrools or perchants that holds knowledge about the techniques or creating powerfull runes. Once obtained one, you must go and study it 
with any scientists NPCs. Together will learn the process that take to create a specific rune described in that scroll of perchant.
Be aware that Runes S, Rune IV and Rune V can be crafted only by the NPCs that learned the process not like other lower ranked runes. E.I. lowe ranked runes can be 
learned at one NPC and crafted by any of them, where higher ranked runes can be only crated at the specific NPC that you give it the scroll or perchant.
You cannot learn twice the same craft and you dont need again the scroll or perchant when you craft that rune, only the necessary materials.

	There are 3 scientists around the "World Game" , each of them having more and more experience, meaning that the lower the NPC is the lower the chance to learn a higher craft it. With other words, the chance to learn and later the chance to success to craft a specific rune, depends of the rank of the NPC.
	
	Rank III : Bobstein Scientist (looks like Einstein) is the highest NPC as Rank, located in the "Middlean Island".
	Rank II : Belltosheink located in "Ancient City of Sankis" in "Aarong Forest".
	Rank I : Garlik Shten located in "Gryveer Field" in "Sunnymead Island".
	Rank I : Anthony Parker located in "Copthorne".
