			Mask of Hollow Faces

	Description : The Mask of Hollow Faces is a finely crafted porcelain mask painted with muted, forgettable expressions. The artistry lies not in detail, but in the
lack of it — its blank, featureless face makes the wearer seem utterly unremarkable to casual observers. Rumors claim these masks are enchanted with misdirection 
runes stolen from old Knight archives, making the eye slide away from the wearer as though they were just another civilian in the crowd.

	Mechanics :
* Effect : Alters the player’s face and silhouette, causing guards and civilians to perceive them as a harmless neutral civilian.
* Functionality :
	*Guard Suspicion Reduction : Lowers Guard Suspicion by 50% in Knight-controlled cities.
	*Zone Access : Allows limited access to Marketplaces, Taverns, and Outer Military Zones. Does not grant entry to restricted elite zones (Royal Quarters, Vaults).
	*Civilian Blend : Some civilian NPCs will treat the wearer as “familiar” (dialogue adjusted).
*Detection Mechanics :
	* Elite Guards, Inquisitors, or NPCs with "True Sight" abilities can pierce the mask.
	* Each suspicious interaction (e.g., loitering near nobles, attempting theft) raises "Inspection Chance" by 10%. If inspected, the mask crumbles and the player is
exposed.
*Duration : 15 minutes continuous use.
*Cooldown : 30 minutes after breaking or expiring.
*Failure Consequence : If disguise breaks, the player immediately gains "Criminal Charge" debuff and becomes hostile to all guards nearby.

	Acquisition :
*Faction : Knights (exclusive).
*Sources :
	*Crafted by outlaw "Enchanters" who blend porcelain masks with enchanted runes.
	* Rarely sold by "Black Market NPCs" operating in slums or abandoned districts of the Knight capital.
	* Reward from special "Faction Questlines" (e.g., assisting a thieves’ guild with infiltrating the Royal Market).
