			Forged Documents

	Description : Forged Documents are bundles of counterfeit travel passes, merchant permits, or military orders, carefully crafted by black-market scribes and 
smugglers. The parchment looks official enough at first glance, complete with false wax seals and forged signatures. While the documents fool most low- to mid-ranking
officials, they are flimsy under closer inspection by captains, inquisitors, or high-level guards.

	Mechanics :

*Effect : Grants access to restricted areas (e.g., Military Quarters, Central Plaza) by tricking guards into believing the player is a legal citizen or merchant.
*Functionality :
	* On interaction with restricted-zone guards, the disguise holds unless the guard performs an “Inspection.”
	* Each guard interaction has a "15% chance" of triggering exposure.
	* If exposed, disguise is destroyed and player receives "Criminal Charge" (standard debuff).
*Duration : Persists until destroyed by exposure or when leaving the guarded zone.
*Cooldown : N/A (consumable, destroyed on use/exposure).
*Risk : High suspicion in areas with elite guards, inquisitors, or special "Detection NPCs".

	Acquisition :

*Faction : Knight lands (primary availability).
*Sources :
	* Purchased from "Black Market Vendors" hidden in backrooms of taverns (Knight capital city and certain towns).
	* Dropped rarely from "Criminal NPCs" (Smugglers, Bandits, Rogue Factions) in dungeons or outlaw camps.
	* Craftable only by Outlaw-aligned "Scribes" with special ink (requires "Ink of False Sigils" recipe).
