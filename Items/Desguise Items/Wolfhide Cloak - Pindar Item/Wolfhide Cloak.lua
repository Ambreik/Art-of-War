			Wolfhide Cloak

	Description : The Wolfhide Cloak is a brutal statement piece among the Pindars — a garment stitched from the pelts of wolves slain in ritual hunts. To wear one is
to declare loyalty to the packs, for its fibers carry the musk of wolf blood and fur. When draped around the shoulders, it overwhelms nearby scents with an aura of 
predator dominance, confusing ordinary guard dogs, weaker beasts, and even some low-ranking werewolves. However, this same primal stench is a double-edged blade: if a
keen-nosed Pindar Alpha becomes suspicious, the disguise collapses instantly, exposing the user’s true identity.

	Mechanics :
*Effect : Reduces "Guard Suspicion" in urban areas by 40% for 10 minutes.
*Twist : Masks presence from ordinary guards, but does not mask scent against werewolf NPCs.
*Detection Risk : If a werewolf NPC attempts to sniff the wearer, the cloak immediately fails.
*Failure Consequence : On failure, the wearer gains the "Marked by the Pack" debuff instantly, making them a priority target for Pindar hunters.
*Cooldown : 20 minutes after effect ends or is broken.

	Acquisition :
*Faction : Pindars (exclusive).
*Sources :
  * Crafted by "Leatherworkers" within Pindar territory using wolf pelts dropped by factional beasts.
  * Sold by "Clan Outfitters" in Pindar villages, often requiring a mix of currency and wolfhide trophies.
  * Awarded for completing initiation trials that involve hunting wild wolves in the forests of "Zonen".
