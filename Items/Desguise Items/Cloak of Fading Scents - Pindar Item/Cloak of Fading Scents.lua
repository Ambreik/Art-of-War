			Cloak of Fading Scents

	Description : The Cloak of Fading Scents is a tattered but deceptively powerful garment, woven from swamp reeds and treated with outlaw alchemy. Its fibers are 
soaked in oils from rare herbs that distort or suppress natural scent trails. To the human eye, it looks like nothing more than a ragged travel cloak, but to the keen
nose of a werewolf or Pindar hunter, it is a fog — a swirling confusion that makes the wearer’s trail indistinct. Many whisper it was first developed by defectors who
fled the Pindar packs and needed a way to disappear from their hunters.

	Mechanics :
*Effect : Suppresses or alters the wearer’s scent trail, making it significantly harder for Pindar patrols and werewolf NPCs to detect them.
*Functionality :
	*Scent Disguise : Lowers scent detection radius by 70%.
	*Tracking Confusion : Werewolf NPCs following a trail have a 50% chance of losing it when the cloak is active.
	*Countermeasure : Alpha NPCs or Pindar warlocks may still pierce the cloak’s effect with heightened senses.
*Duration : 10 minutes continuous use.
*Cooldown : 20 minutes.
*Failure Consequence : If a werewolf manages to pierce the disguise, the wearer becomes "Marked by the Pack" immediately, and all nearby Pindar NPCs are alerted.

	Acquisition :
*Faction : Pindars (exclusive).
*Sources :
	*Crafted by "Pindar Herbalists" in their capital using rare plants found in the forests of "Dendera".
	*Occasionally awarded as part of "Pack Loyalty Questlines" (e.g., aiding in hunts, retrieving outlaw traitors).
	*Can also be purchased from "Pindar Clan Quartermasters" in faction cities.
