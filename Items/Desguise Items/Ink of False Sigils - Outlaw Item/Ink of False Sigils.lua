			Ink of False Sigils

	Description : A small, obsidian vial of thick, shimmering ink used by master forgers and outlaw scribes. The ink is infused with a subtle enchantment that 
mimics the slight press indentation, color tone and drying pattern of legitimate seals and signatures for a short time. In the wrong hands it lets a person fake 
orders, merchant permits or military stamps that look and feel authentic at first glance — enough to fool ordinary clerks and low-ranking guards. Experienced 
inspectors, ritual verifiers, or magical seals can still reveal the fraud.

	Mechanics

*Type/Use : Consumable reagent used to create or alter a forged document. Each vial contains 3 charges (3 stamps). A single charge is consumed when the ink is used 
to imprint a seal/signature on parchment or to refresh an existing forged permit.
*Primary Effect : When applied to a document and presented, the resulting "Forged Document" functions like an official permit for the purposes defined by the 
document (access a zone, pass customs, command a cargo release, etc.), until it is inspected or otherwise invalidated.
*Inspection Chance :
	- Every interaction where the player must use the document to gain an advantage (pass a checkpoint, request docking rights, enter a restricted building) invokes
	an inspection roll. Base chance that a guard chooses to perform an inspection: 15% per interaction.
	- If inspection occurs, a secondary forgery-detection roll determines success of exposure. Base detection chance on inspection: 25%. If detection succeeds, the 
	forged document is revealed as fake immediately.
* Modifiers to Detection/Inspection :
	- Higher-rank guards / Investigators / Magic Sentinels : increase the detection chance by +30% and increase the chance to inspect.
	- Outlaw Scribe Quality : Vials crafted by master outlaw scribes (higher-tier Ink) reduce the detection roll by -10% (so base detection = 15%).
	- Player Reputation : High outlaw/forger reputation lowers chance of inspection by a small amount (-5% to -10%), while positive official reputation raises 
	inspection chance.
	- Location : Military Quarters, Royal Districts, and Harbormaster towers have +10% inspection chance.
* Consequences on Exposure :
	- The forged document is destroyed on exposure (consumed).
	- Player receives a "Criminal Charge" (standard global debuff) and in Pindar territories also receives increased local response; additionally, If the document 
	was used to impersonate a military/Noble authority, the bounty penalty is doubled (outlaw double-penalty rule).
	- Nearby guards immediately become hostile and spawn additional investigation NPCs (bounty hunters or inquisitors) depending on the severity.
* Limitations & Rules :
	- Ink cannot be applied in combat.
	- Ink-created forgeries are temporary — any magical seals or rune-based authentication (permanent seals, warded scrolls) will bypass the fake instantly 
	(auto-detect).
	- Using an Ink-imprinted document repeatedly increases cumulative suspicion: each successful non-inspected use adds a small stacking suspicion counter that 
	increases both inspection chance and detection roll on subsequent interactions until the document is destroyed or the player leaves the controlled zone for a 
	cooldown period.
* Risk / Tradeoff :
	- Powerful tool for infiltration and bypassing bureaucracy, but carries high risk: discovery triggers heavy legal consequences and the double-bounty modifier 
	for impersonating high authorities.
	- Outlaw-forged vials (made cheaply) cost less but have higher detection rates than master-forged ink.

	Acquisition

* Faction Availability : Primarily Outlaw faction (Caerlis Keep) crafting specialty — but outlaw networks sell limited supplies to trusted contacts in other 
capitals via black-market stalls (reputation-gated).

* Sources :
	- Craft : Crafted by the "Scribe" or "Forgery" profession (Outlaw-only recipe). Requires Scribe skill + rare components: "Shade Pigment", "Ghostwater", and 
	"Night Threaded Quill". Craft yields a 3-charge vial. Master Scribes produce higher-quality vials with reduced detection.
	- Buy : Purchased from black-market scribes or outlaw vendors in "Caerlis Keep", sometimes available from slum vendors in major capitals 
	(very rare; likely expensive and reputation-locked).
	- Drop : Rare drop from "Outlaw Scribe NPCs", high-tier Smuggler Lieutenants, or found in smuggler caches across Outland Territories and Middlean Islands.
	- Reward : Occasionally given as a mission reward from outlaw questlines or special infiltration contracts.
