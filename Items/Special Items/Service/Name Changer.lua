			Name Changer
	
	
	Name Changer is a paid service that allows players to choose a new name for a character. The Name Changer is also included with the Appearance Change, Race Change,
and Faction Change services, but can be purchased separately.
	Other players on the same realm will be unable to use the old name for 90 days. The player that changed the name will be able to use it otherwise. Your character 
cannot have their name changed for three days after purchasing this service and the purchase cannot be cancelled once the confirmation button has been pressed.
	Your existing mail and auctions will not be interrupted or canceled, but you should let your friends know before you make the change so they don't send new mail 
to the old name.
	Characters whose names are changed will remain on your ignore list, but their names will be updated automatically.
	Your character will remain in your guild and you will remain on all friends lists. The only difference is that you will have a new name, so you should let your 
friends and guildmates know the new name.
