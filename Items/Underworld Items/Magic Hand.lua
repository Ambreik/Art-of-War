			Magic Hand
			
	Description:
"Magic Hand" is an item that automates the looting process, providing a limited-time enhancement to the player's looting efficiency. It can be 
crafted, earned, or purchased, with variations in duration and usability.  

	Key Details:
1. Crafting & Acquisition :
   - Crafted by the Hunter profession, with a base duration of 2 hours (time decreases only when active).  
   - Earned through quest rewards or specific loot drops.  
   - Available in the Item Shop, with extended durations (7, 15, or 30 days).  

2. Behavior :
   - Activation consumes the item, creating a UI Buff displaying remaining time.  
   - If acquired through crafting or rewards, it cannot pause during gameplay but halts during logouts.  
   - Item Shop versions continue to function uninterrupted.  

3. Usage Restrictions :
   - Functions only in applicable environments (e.g., outdoor areas).  
   - Non-bind-on-acquire items are prioritized in autoloot.
