Leadership

Allows you to give special powers to your Groupmember. For that knowledge you need lv. 90.
Like the other skills the leadership is subdivided in:
Level 1-20 (is trained with Book of Leadership [BL] ) 1 per day or if you use the Focus Reading you are able to read again another book.
Level M1-M10 (is trained with Soul Stone of Leadership [SSL] ) 1 per hour or if you use the Focus Reading you are able to read again another book.
Level G1-G10 (is trained with Special Soul Stone of Leadership [SSSL] ) 1 per 3 hours or if you use the Focus Reading you are able to read again another book.
Level P

The special powers

On the different levels of leadership you'll get the option to give some special "positions" and with this a special power to your group member(s). 
However it only works if your groupmember is close to the groupleader like it is on the exp-bonus. There is only one special "position" per group member and 
only one special power in the whole group.
Level 1-19

If you managed your tenth BL you are allowed to set a group member (NOT YOURSELF!) to an attacker. 
The group member at this stage receives more attack power if they are close to you.
leadership	Set as attacker

10	+23 AP
11	+24 AP
12	+25 AP
13	+26 AP
14	+28 AP
15	+29 AP
16	+30 AP
17	+31 AP
18	+32 AP
19	+34 AP
Level M1-M5

If you have managed your twentieth BL, leadership will change to M1 and you receive 2 more options for your group. 
Now you are allowed to give the special "position" "Set as berserker"(group member gets more attack speed) and "Set as melee" (groupmember gets more health).
From now on SSL will work like an normal skill book and there remain the same reading progression between the levels.
leadership	Set as attacker	Set as berserker	Set as melee

M1	+40 AP	+3 AS	MaxHP +775
M2	+41 AP	+3 AS	MaxHP +804
M3	+42 AP	+3 AS	MaxHP +833
M4	+43 AP	+3 AS	MaxHP +862
M5	+44 AP	+3 AS	MaxHP +890
Level M6-M10

Within level M5 you get "Set as blocker". But at this time you can't give it to a group member until you have level M6. 
This is a power which allows your group member to have longer duration with their spells. This length is not written down in the description of the power but 
you can take a measure the increase manually.
leadership	Set as attacker	Set as berserker	Set as melee	Set as blocker

M6	+46 AP	+4 AS	MaxHP +920	Length of spell: +32
M7	+47 AP	+4 AS	MaxHP +963	Length of spell: +33
M8	+49 AP	+4 AS	MaxHP +1.007	Length of spell: +34
M9	+51 AP	+4 AS	MaxHP +1.050	Length of spell: +36
M10	+53 AP	+4 AS	MaxHP +1.094	Length of spell: +37
Level G1-P

From G1 and G6 on new powers will appear. One of them is "Set as defender". From level P onwards, 2 of your group members will be allowed to 
have "Set as attacker". The powers "defender" and "wizzard" are bugged with G1. This means they're shown on a image with level G1 but you can't give them to a 
group member.
