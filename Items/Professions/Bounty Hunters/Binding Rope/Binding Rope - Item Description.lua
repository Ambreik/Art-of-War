			Binding Rope - Item Description

	Description : A reinforced rope etched with restraining sigils. It is the primary tool of a Bounty Hunter when securing a target. Once cast, it immediately 
binds and stuns the marked individual, preventing all movement or skills. The rope cannot fail and ensures the target remains in place for capture. Its true power 
is revealed when paired with the Justice Glowing Orb, which instantly transfers the subdued target to the nearest justice hub for judgment.
