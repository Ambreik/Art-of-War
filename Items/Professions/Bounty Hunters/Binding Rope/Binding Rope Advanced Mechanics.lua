			Binding Rope Advanced Mechanics

	When a Binding Rope is used successfully on a player target, a capture interface appears. This interface creates a mini control panel for the "Bounty Hunter" 
while also involving the target in an interactive struggle mechanic, making the capture more dynamic and fair.

	Binding Control Panel (Hunter UI Buttons)

1. Restrain
   * Default action. Keeps the target bound and stunned.
   * Timer: Max 30s hold, can be extended by profession rank (see Extended Hold).
   * Visual: Victim wrapped in glowing rope glyphs.

2. Release
   * Ends the capture voluntarily.
   * Rope is still consumed.

3. Deliver Justice (appears only if the Hunter has a Justice Glowing Orb in inventory)
   * Instantly activates the Orb, teleporting the victim to the nearest Justice Hub (major city Guardian or army Commander).
   * Visual effect: Bright flash + magical chains dragging the victim.
   * Hunter receives confirmation: “Target delivered to justice.”

	Additional Mechanics

1. Extended Hold
* As Bounty Hunters rank up, Binding Rope hold duration increases:
  * Rank I: 30s
  * Rank II: 45s
  * Rank III: 60s

2. Resistance & Struggle Minigame
* Eligible only for player targets, starting at Level 95+.
* Each level above 95 adds +1% resistance chance (95 = 5%, 100 = 10%, etc.).
* When resistance triggers, a struggle minigame starts:
  * A rope line UI appears for both players.
  * The Hunter must keep the rope tight in the middle zone by pressing Spacebar at the right time.
  * The victim also sees the UI and must mash Spacebar to try and break free.
  * The line shifts quickly back and forth → higher-level victims have an edge.
  * If the Hunter keeps control → victim stays bound.
  * If the victim wins → rope breaks, victim escapes.

3. Environmental Limitations
* Can be used : Open World, Dungeons, Battlegrounds.
* Cannot be used : Safe Zones, Instances, Raids, RUNs, Water.
* Prevents abuse and maintains fairness.

4. UI Socket Mechanic
* If a Justice Glowing Orb is in the Hunter’s inventory, a socket slot/button automatically appears on the Binding Control Panel.
* Makes Orb activation seamless with one click during capture.

5. Group Interaction
* If the Hunter is in a party, allies see a “Target Bound” notification with the victim’s name and timer.
* Allies can choose to assist in guarding until delivery.
* In future expansions, escort missions could be tied into this.
