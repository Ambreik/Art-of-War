Introduction
Speed in World Game encompasses two critical gameplay elements: Weapon Speed and Movement Speed. These mechanics influence combat and exploration, creating a dynamic balance between player classes and ensuring strategic depth in gameplay.

Section 1: Weapon Speed
Core Concept:
Weapon speed determines the delay between attacks, influencing the weapon's damage per second (DPS). Each weapon is classified based on:

Attack Damage Value: Physical damage dealt per strike.
Magical Damage Value: Magical damage dealt by specific weapons during skill use.
Attack Speed: Frequency of attacks, represented as the time between strikes.
Class Weapon Assignments:
Warriors:
Knights and Arahans: Swords with medium attack speed, balancing physical attack damage with reliable progression.
Defenders and Paladins: Spears with the lowest attack speed but the highest Attack Damage Value.
Shamans:
Bells: Higher physical Attack Damage Value, used for basic hits.
Fans: Higher Magical Damage Value, ideal for skill usage. Medium attack speed for both.
Warlocks:
Blades: High Attack Damage Value but lower Magical Damage Value.
Scepters: Higher Magical Damage Value, suitable for skill-oriented playstyles. Medium attack speed.
Ninjas:
Assassin and Rogue: Daggers with high attack speed, focused on physical damage only.
Archer and Ranger: Bows with medium attack speed but the highest Attack Damage Value.
Werewolves:
Claws with low attack speed and medium Attack Damage Value, emphasizing tanky close-range combat.
Vampires:
Blood Talons with medium attack speed and a balanced Attack Damage Value.
