			Vampire Blood Talon Weapon
			
Using "Blood Talons" is an excellent choice for the vampire class. Here's why:

Why "Blood Talons" Work Perfectly:
Thematic Fit:
Vampires are traditionally portrayed as predators with sharp, claw-like elegance. "Blood Talons" enhance this idea while feeling mystical rather than primal, aligning with their magical nature.

Integration with the Blood Orb Mechanic:
"Blood Talons" can serve as a channel for absorbing and utilizing blood orbs, adding to the synergy of their combat style and class-specific resource system. For example:

Blood orbs could enhance the talons' damage temporarily.
Talons might grow larger or more menacing as more orbs are absorbed, visually representing the vampire’s increasing power.
Agility and Combat Style:
Vampires are fragile and require an agile, combo-driven combat style. Blood Talons work seamlessly for dual-wielding, quick strikes, and evasive maneuvers, emphasizing their assassin-like qualities.

Unique Visual Appeal:
Blood Talons could glow or shimmer with absorbed blood energy, creating a visual representation of the vampire's life-stealing powers.

Suggested Enhancements for Blood Talons:
Energy-Siphon Mechanic: Every hit could drain a small amount of health or energy from enemies, reinforcing the vampire’s reliance on sustaining themselves in battle.
Customization: Talons could have different appearances based on upgrades or blood orb accumulation (e.g., spectral claws, blood-soaked edges, or shadow-infused talons).
Dual-Role Weaponry: They could extend briefly into "shadow blades" for ranged attacks, providing versatility while keeping the combat close-quarters focused.
Future System Development:
Using Blood Talons as the core weapon opens avenues for unique skills and mechanics, such as:

"Blood Surge": Releases absorbed blood orbs in a powerful area-of-effect attack.
"Shadow Leap": Dash behind enemies and strike with amplified damage using the talons.
"Blood Hunger": Temporarily boosts attack speed and life-steal based on the number of orbs collected.
