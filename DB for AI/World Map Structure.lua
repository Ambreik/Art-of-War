		This was my description for you regarding the World Map Structure : 

"Now, lets speak about the World Map a bit, because you sometimes make big mistakes.
World Game have a unique World Map.
In the middle is represented by a group of 7 islands (we spoke only about Capital City which is the main hub here) and the region here is called Middlean Islands.
In the west side is placed the continent called Dendera, which consist into 3 major regions.
In the east side is placed the continent called Zonen, which similar with Dendera continent, consist into 3 major regions.Those to continents, Dendera, represent the starting point of faction of the nights, where Zonen represent the starting point for the pindars faction, being as a mirroring image, on faction opposite to the other one on the World Game and World Map.
In the north side of the World Map, is a big continent called "Outland Territories" which constist of 4 distinct regions and having unique mechanics, each devided from the another one by a tall mountain branches that cannot be crossed by any means, to separate the individual environment. Those regions are :
*Aarong Forest placed in the Southern side of the continent.
*Frozen Territory placed in the East side of the continent.
*Lagooma Jungle placed in the Northern side of the continent.
*Tenebress Territory placed in the western side of the continent.
This is part of the 2nd expansion of the game.

Between "Middlean Islands" region and "Outland Territory" is another region called "Vashthara" and is found in this realm called "Underwater Realm".

In the south side of the World Map, is a continent called "Legrand" that consist into 3 major regions as : "Garland" as main region, "Aspen Woods" and "Sudeon". This is part of the 3rd expansion of the game and serves as an end game content.

Underwater Realm, represent the whole water territory that surround the continents and found also between all the continents and is split into 2 separate regions as : 
*Great Sea is located between the continents, where the "Middlean Islands" is placed.
*Grean Ocean is the water that surrounds all the continents as an edge of the World Map.

Underworld Realm is a separate realm that is placed let say as a paralel world beneath the "human realm". This consist of 3 major regions as :
*Dread Land located in northern side.
*High Isle located in South-East side.
*Sangaria located in Westhern side.
In the western side of this realm, is a human territory called "Eldergate".
Also this realm have a few islands around the the continent (we havent got into those yet to develop)"

"Thank you for the detailed explanation of your **World Map**! Here's a recap of how I understand the structure:

### **World Map Overview**:
The **World Game** features a unique map that is divided into several key regions, each representing different environments, realms, and territories that players will explore.

1. **Middlean Islands**: 
   - **Capital City** is the central hub here. This region serves as the heart of the game world, and the 7 islands here are significant to the story.

2. **Continents:**
   - **Dendera** (West side of the map): This continent serves as the starting point for the **Knights** faction, consisting of 3 major regions.
   - **Zonen** (East side of the map): This continent serves as the starting point for the **Pindars** faction and mirrors Dendera with its own 3 major regions.

3. **Outland Territories** (North of the map):
   - A massive continent containing **4 distinct regions**. These regions are separated by tall mountain ranges, making them geographically isolated.
     - **Aarong Forest** (Southern side)
     - **Frozen Territory** (Eastern side)
     - **Lagooma Jungle** (Northern side)
     - **Tenebress Territory** (Western side)
   - This area is part of the 2nd expansion and introduces unique mechanics.

4. **Vashthara (Underwater Realm)**:
   - Situated between the **Middlean Islands** and **Outland Territories**, this is a **water-based region**. It is a central area that connects the other regions in the world.

5. **Legrand** (Southern side of the World Map):
   - This continent consists of **3 regions** and serves as end-game content:
     - **Garland** (Main region)
     - **Aspen Woods**
     - **Sudeon**

6. **Underwater Realm**:
   - Two water territories are found here:
     - **Great Sea**: Located between the continents, near the Middlean Islands.
     - **Grean Ocean**: Surrounds all the continents and marks the edge of the World Map.

7. **Underworld Realm** (Parallel world beneath the human realm):
   - This realm contains **3 major regions**:
     - **Dread Land** (Northern side)
     - **High Isle** (South-East side)
     - **Sangaria** (Western side)
   - **Eldergate** is a human territory located on the western side of this realm, and there are additional islands to be developed around it.

### **Key World Structure Points**:
- **Dendera** and **Zonen** are the starting points for the **Knights** and **Pindars** factions, respectively. These continents are mirror images of each other, with each faction’s races and classes tied to them.
- **Outland Territories** and **Vashthara** are areas of expansion that offer unique gameplay mechanics.
- **Legrand** is a high-level end-game region, offering intense challenges.
- **Underworld Realm** provides an alternate dimension for exploration with its own set of regions, including **Eldergate**, a human-controlled territory within the realm.

This structure gives your world a layered, expansive feel, offering distinct territories, each with unique environments and challenges. If you’d like to dive deeper into each region’s mechanics, NPCs, or other specific details, I’m happy to help!"
