		this was my description for you regarding the Factions, Races and Classes : 
		
"we have to go back a bit to recap this. 
Ninja without a specific description is refers to bot races (one race from from dendera and one race from zonen) This Ninja is grouped in 2 races as : 
Race of range attack dealers : Archers that is a class specific to the knights, and Rangers that is specific to the pindars.
Melee class or Ninja : Assassin is a class of ninja specific to the nights and rogue is specific to the pindars.
Warriors on the other hand, same as ninja is a race used for both factions, knights and pindars, such
Warrior tank class : Defender is specific to the knights and Paladins specific to the pindars.
Warrior melee class : Knight specific for knights and Arahan is specific for pindars.
Shaman is a race of characters specific only for knights and have 2 pleyable classes such : 
Healer that is considered a buffer class due to its skills that perform perfect as aid and Dragon class that is based on bursting skills than group or party aids.
Warlocks is a race equivalet with Shaman race but is specific to pindars. Have also 2 classes :
Sorcerer that act similar with Healer class that perform with aiding skills, and Necromancer that is same as Dragon class, based on burst skills.
Werewolfs are specific only to the pindars and are more as a tanky class.
Vampires are specificonly to the knights and are more as a burst damage but are very squishy.

Now, knights are called the players which represent the faction of Dendera and pindars represent the players which choosed Zonen faction. Similar with World of Warcraft structure of factions, let say,knights are the aliance and pindars are the horde. To be easy for you to understand the structure of my World Game view.
Did you understand ? Please dont be confused about the playable class called "Knight" that is only a class that share the same name with "Knight" as playable faction."

		This was your reply of understanding the Factions, Races and Classes in the World Game : 
		
"Got it! Here's a recap of the structure:

Ninjas:

Split into two roles based on range vs melee combat:
Range Attack Dealers: Archers (Knights faction) and Rangers (Pindars faction).
Melee Classes: Assassins (Knights faction) and Rogues (Pindars faction).
Warriors:

Split into two roles based on tank vs melee:
Warrior Tank Class: Defender (Knights faction) and Paladin (Pindars faction).
Warrior Melee Class: Knight (Knights faction) and Arahan (Pindars faction).
Shamans:

Only for Knights faction and include two classes:
Healer: A buffer class with skills focused on aiding.
Dragon: A burst damage class, focused on offense.
Warlocks:

Only for Pindars faction and include two classes:
Sorcerer: A buffer class similar to Healer.
Necromancer: A burst damage class, similar to Dragon.
Werewolves:

Only for Pindars faction, a tanky class that can absorb damage and endure.
Vampires:

Only for Knights faction, a squishy, burst-damage class. They focus on agility and damage output but are fragile.
Knights: Represent the Dendera faction (similar to the "Alliance" in WoW).

Pindars: Represent the Zonen faction (similar to the "Horde" in WoW).

You can think of "Knights" as the Dendera faction, "Pindars" as the Zonen faction, with the classes for each faction having unique roles based on their race.

Now that this is clear, let me know if you'd like to move forward with this structure in your game development or need further adjustments!"
