	This was my details for you : 
"Underwater Realm section that you dont get, is the water that exist into the world game. is divided into 2 sections. Great Sea is located as the water that is found in the middle of the world map between the continents, and Middlean Islands, because are islands, ae located on the water situated in the middle of the world map. 
Think about real world for a moment. The key element of our world is water, where the continents are situated on. Yes? Now all the continents let say are placed each of them in a cercle and in the middle of them, this water is called a sea, in our case, this is the Great Sea, where those 7 islands called middlean islands are located. And the outside water mass that surround our continents is called great ocean. Now you understand ?"

	This was your reply for me : 
"Got it! Now I fully understand how the Underwater Realm and the seas in your World Game are structured:

The Great Sea is located at the center of the World Map, acting like the "sea" in the middle of the continents, where the Middlean Islands (which are made up of 7 islands) are situated. This is a central body of water, surrounded by all the continents, just like how real-world seas or oceans surround landmasses.

The Great Ocean, on the other hand, is the massive body of water that surrounds all the continents, forming the outer boundary of the world map, and is akin to the "world ocean" that encircles the known world.

This structure reflects a more geographically logical approach:

The Great Sea is the sea at the center where the Middlean Islands are found, akin to an "island cluster" in the middle of the world's landmasses.
The Great Ocean is the outer water, creating a boundary around the continents, like the oceans surrounding continents in the real world.
Now that this is clear, I understand how the water territories are organized within your game world. The Underwater Realm encompasses the Great Sea in the center and the Great Ocean on the outer edges, both providing distinct zones of exploration in the game world.
