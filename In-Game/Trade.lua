	Trading is the way players exchange items, money and some services.
	
		How to trade with other players
	1. Click on the player character , right-click on their portrait, and select Trade.

	2. A window will appear with several areas:
	
	The right pane shows what you wish to trade, with item slots and a place to enter any money or some currency, you wish to pay.
	The left pane shows what your target wishes to trade, with several item slots.
	Each side have 12 slots.
	
	3. Add the items you want to trade or expose and/or currency you want to trade on the right side:
*Drag items you want to give to the other player in the upper slots.
	
	4. Enter any curency you want to give in the entry fields at the bottom. Once click in this field, a list pop-up with all currency that you already own. Click on
desire one and after put the value in the empty field space.
NOTE: A warning alert will appear asking you to confirm the trade of money before the trade completes, if you decide to do that. end end 
	
	5. Click the Trade button and your area (the right side) will become highlighted in green. If the player you are trading with clicks their Trade button, their 
area (the left side) will become highlighted in green also and the trade will complete.
NOTE: Once you put an item or currency, is no way to change it, and another trade must be done.
	
	Bottoms : 
*TRADE : press this botton once you finish to add items and/or currency.
*CANCEL : press this botton when you refuse the trade.
*REFRESH : in later patch, a new botton is added to refresh the whole right side of window, where everything was added including currency to be refreshed giving a 
new option to add new stuf in it.

	
		Supplying materials for an enhancement on a soulbound item
	You might find yourself supplying the required materials in order for someone else to enhance a piece of your equipment. In order to do this, you must first 
trade the materials to the other person. Since this is a separate trade action, there is a risk of an unscrupulous player running off with your materials. Be sure to
take precautions to avoid this, such as only trading with reputable players and taking steps to verify that the player is actually capable of performing the desired 
enhancement. If a player steals your materials, your only recourse is to seek help from a Game Master via a ticket. end 
	One way to eliminate the chance of being scammed is to have a player who already has the required materials enchant your equipment. Simply place both the 
materials and the item to be enhanced into the trade window and have them enchant your gear in the same trading session, making sure to only confirm the trade when 
they apply the desired enhancement.

		
		Additional notes
*Players can trade during combat but is automatically close when one of them is killed.
*You must be within a certain distance of the character you want to trade with to begin the trade. The trade will automatically cancel if either player moves out of 
trade range. end 
*You can trade an item by dragging it onto the target character and letting go of the left mouse button.
*You can't trade with a character that's logging out and doesnt stop the target from logging out.
*Players can choose to ignore all incoming trades via the options menu.
*When trading large numbers of items, right-clicking stacks is much faster than dragging them to the trade window.
*Knights can trade with Pindars.
