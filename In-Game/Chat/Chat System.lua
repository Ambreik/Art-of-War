			Chat
			
	Chat is the primary form of text-based communications in "World Game". It is usually initiated by pressing "Enter" to get to a command line. Voice Chat was 
released in later Patch along with the Chat Channels panel in the Socials window.

	Additional notes
*Player characters from opposing factions can only use /s, /y, or /e (say, yell, or emote) channels to communicate and all messages will be seen by the opposing 
faction will appear in the faction language of the speaking character, except through emotes. An opposing faction player can be understand only if the player 
learned the language of the opposing faction such as "Book of Dendera" for pindars or "Book of Zonen" for knights. end
