			Combat Log

	The Combat Log is a log of combat actions and results, but may also show the results of the profession activities of nearby characters.
	All messages related to combat appear in this window. Watch it during combat to see how you are affecting your opponent, and vice versa.

	By default, it is accessible via a Combat Log tab on the General chat window. Combat Logs may be written to a file using the /combatlog command. The resulting 
file may be found at "Art of War\extract\logs\CombatLog.txt".
