			Green
			
	The color green is used in "World Game" in various different ways. One way is as part of the usual quality color system for items (gray, white, green, blue,purple,
orange, gold) or difficulty for mobs (gray, green, yellow, orange, red) and tradeskill recipes (gray, green, yellow, orange).

		Green Items
	Some items' names appear in green letters. This is part of the item quality system: "green items" (whether Weapons, Armor or something else) are of Uncommon 
quality, better than Common but not as good as Rare.

		Green Mobs
	Some mobs' level numbers appear in green digits, although the color depends on the level of the character who views them. "Green mobs" are mobs that, despite 
being of lower level than your character and therefore relatively easy to kill,still yield experience. Gray mobs are too low level for you to get experience from them.
Yellow, orange and red mobs are more of a challenge and therefore worth more experience to you.
	Even though a max level character can no longer accumulate experience, the difference between a gray and green mob is still important to Warlocks or Vampires: they
can only obtain a "Soul Orbs" from a green or better mob.
	Green monsters ar usually Rank II.
	
		Green Names
	If the overhead name of a mob or NPC is green to you, this signifies that the unit in question is friendly to you but attackable by enemy players (their PvP Flag 
is on). Flagged players who are in your party have dark red names; otherwise, flagged players' names appear a light blue.
	All friendly NPC names are green.
	
		Green in Professions
	In your profession window, a recipe shown in green will rarely give you a skillup when used. These recipes are considered "moderately easy". The same is the case 
for the gathering professions, a dead body for example, which shows "skinnable" in green will only have a small chance of giving you a skill point, whereas a yellow 
one will have a high chance and an orange one always will. A gray one means that it's below your skill level and will never give you a skillup.

		Green Bonus
	A green bonus mean all the values of the bonuses found on an item are under 50% of their total even if the item have already full bonuses or not.
