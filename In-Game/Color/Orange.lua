			Orange 
			
	The color orange is used in "World Game" in various different ways. One way is as part of the usual quality color system for items (gray, white, green, blue, 
purple, orange, gold) or difficulty for mobs (gray, green, yellow, orange, red) and tradeskill recipes (gray, green, yellow, orange).
		
		Orange items
	Some items' names appear in orange letters. This is part of the item quality system: "orange items" (whether weapons, armor or something else) are of Legendary 
quality, better than Epic but not as good as Special. These items are extremely rare and generally only come from crafting an epic item then completing a mini-chain
quest for "Legendary Blacksmith".

		Orange mobs
	Orange monsters are usually high ranked mobs from Rank III-IV and always have a type of "anger", "Berserk", "vampiric". Also can be found for WB and some special 
"Indoor" Bosses. Those are always Boss category or Special Bosses.

		Orange names

you can't talk to them. Although all "Guardians" are chasing and attack you on sight if you go into their radar range.
	
		Orange recipes
	In your profession window, a recipe shown in orange should always give you a skillup when used (assuming you have not hit the ceiling of your skill range). These 
recipes are considered "difficult".
