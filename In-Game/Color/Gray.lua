			Color
			
	Colors in graphic highlights or text in "World Game" usually indicate the state of creatures (difficulty or reputation), items (quality), players (PvP state), 
quests (difficulty), recipes (difficulty or skillup potential), or resource nodes (difficulty or skillup potential).

	The color gray is used in "World Game" in various different ways. Quality color system for items (gray, white, green, blue, purple, orange, red) or difficulty for 
mobs (gray, green, yellow, orange, red) and tradeskill recipes (gray, green, yellow, orange).
		
		Gray Items
	Gray items are often referred to as Vendor Trash. These are items that generally have no good use compared to other items you could get that are of higher quality.
	Gray items, despite their uselessness, can sometimes sell for a good amount to a vendor.
	Some gray items have also good use as "recipes" for different crafts.
	
		Gray Mobs
	Gray mobs are of a level much lower than yours. These mobs do not give experience. Once a mob is grey to you, it is normally quite easy to kill. There are some 
exceptions though. end 
	Warlocks or Vampires cannot gain "Soul Orbs" from Gray mobs.
	Gray monsters are usually Rank I.
	
		Gray Levels (PvP)
	In PvP, when someone's level is gray to you, you cannot gain any  [Honor Grade] points from them. So, in other words, it is not worth your time to kill them.
	
		Gray Recipes
	In your profession window, a recipe shown in gray will never give you a skillup when used. These recipes are considered "easy".
	
		Gray Nodes
	For gathering-type professions (skinning, herbalism, mining), a gray node (skinnable corpse, etc.) will not give you a skillup when used.

		Gray Quests
	In your quest window, a quest shown in gray is intended to be completed at a much lower level than your current level. You will receive little, if any, experience 
for completing gray quests. end 

		Gray Bonus
	On your items, gray bonuses represent minimum percent or uselessness and are not improving quality of stats with much.
