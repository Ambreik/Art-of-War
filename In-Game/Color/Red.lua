			Red
			
	The color red is used in "World Game" in various different ways. One way it may be used is as part of the color system for items (gray, white, green, blue, purple, 
orange, red) or mobs (gray, green, yellow, orange, red). 

		Red Items
	There are items with a red rarity level called "Special" items and are equipment items with are a higher quality than "Legendary" and are found as drop only with a
very low chance at some WB, NB and "Indoor" Bosses. 
	Some red recipes also are very rare items and are called sometimes unique recipes because the chance to drop is very small. This recipes are found in various 
places as drop from WB, NB, "Indoor" Bosses, "World Chest", "Submercible Chest". Also can be dropped by aquatic monsters in "Great Sea" but never reward from quests.
	Some items have red color bonuses when "Augment" was used on them and "Resistance" was added to them, are showed in red under yellow color bonuses in tooltip.

		Red Mobs
	Red monsters are always "Notorious Monsters" because of their ability to have multiple HP Bars and beigh too way difficult to encounter by a solo or small group of 
players. Also Bosses from "Tower of Infinite" are red monsters because represent the supreme Bosses of elements and also have an unique mechanics in game. 

		Red Names
	Red names refer to a PK Player, a traitor of its own faction, but a "Pindar" player is in "Purple" color where also can be seen the flag of the faction above its 
head.
	The color of the name of a hostile mob in the main play screen will always be red when is in combat with you. In the Player vs Player system, if two members of 
opposite factions were allowed to attack one another, each would appear with a red name to the other.
