			Keybag
			
	The keybag was a sixth bag slot later 32 bag slot that could be opened with the "CTRL + K" or key logo button that held a number of keys, most usefully dungeon 
keys among other keys, with dynamic capacity. Not all keys or items with key in their names were compatible with the keybag.
	When a player first acquired a key, they automatically acquired a keybag that held compatible keys. The keybag sized dynamically for the number of keys in 
possession, up to 32 keys.

		Keybag UI
	The keybag is a botton found in the status bar, next to inventory botton.
	The keybag appeared as a thin key icon found next to inventory icon. Clicking this revealed a bag similar to a normal container.
	Right-clicking a key in your bank moved that key into a normal inventory bag slot.
	The keybag adjusted the number of slots to always accommodate all keys. It expanded until there were 32 total slots filled.
	Also in this bag, all exact key are stacked up to 25.
