			Achievements Window
			
	Clicking the button opens up the achievements window.
	The top of the window displays the total number of points received for completing achievements. Below, each achievement appears with its name, description, point 
value, the completion date, and a progress bar (if applicable). Some achievements expand to display a list of individual components, highlighted to show which parts 
the player has finished. Players can also select achievements to track as they play, similar to the quest tracker.
	At the bottom of the "Achievements Window" are the Achievements and Stats tabs. The Statistics tab shows a Statistics panel.
	
		Categories
	Achievements come in several varieties. Some simply require specific actions to unlock, such as getting a haircut or defeating a member of each race in your 
opposing faction in PvP. Others involve a progress bar and require you to do something several times — such as give out 10 hugs. Some achievements are progressive; for 
example, once you complete an achievement to collect 10 vanity pets, you might next be asked to collect 25. Some achievements, including those that involve 
quests, honorable kills, items currently in your possession, skills (including professions), exploration, and reputations, are applied to your character retroactively.
	
	To help keep track of all the different achievements you can unlock, players find the following categories in the achievements window:
*Summary: Shows the most recent achievement earned and the amount of achievements earned from each category.
*Character: These achievements tend to lean toward character advancement, such as leveling up, learning to ride mounts or gathering large amounts of gold.
*Quests: Quest-based achievements include completing a certain number of quests and completing specific quest lines. This category contains zone-specific subcategories.
*Exploration: You’ll earn achievements by exploring each zone in the game — and get meta-achievements when you fully explore a continent. This category also includes #
related achievements such as defeating rare mobs and discovering treasures and lore objects.
*Player vs. Player: This includes arena, battleground, and world Player vs. Player objectives.
*Dungeons & Runs: Every end boss of every Run, Dungeon or Instance in the game grants its own achievement. This category also contains achievements for killing 
instance bosses within certain time limits, without the full amount of players present, or succeeding in certain other special conditions.
*Professions: Advancing to each tier of mastery in a profession earns you an achievement, and there are specific achievements for secondary skills.
*Reputation: This set of achievements includes attaining exalted reputation with each faction in the game.
*World Events: Seasonal events have specific achievements of their own.
*Collections: These include Mounts,Pets and Artifacts.

*Maybe Next Time Achievements : Those are all missed achievements that a character was not able to finish in time for the period of an event or season. Some of those
can be done next time but some of them was only one time such achievements to be done. All of them can be checked individual.x
