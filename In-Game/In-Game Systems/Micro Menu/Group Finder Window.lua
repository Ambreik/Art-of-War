			Group Finder Window
			
	Group Finder Window is a system for finding groups Dungeons, Runs or Instances. Group Finder can be accessed through the Micro Menu or default keybind : CTRL + F. 
	Group Finder is unlocked at level 25 and can be a way to teleport free to various locations that are accesible for each faction. If the character/s use this system
only to teleport but without to enter to attend to complete or at least to try the dungeon/run/instance, a cooldown of 1hour is applied to respective character. This
cooldown work only when the character is online preventing them to not be able to trick the the system going offline for the duration.

	Group Finder selects players to form a party from entire server of a respective faction in the battlegroup, that are each of them individual are looking for a 
group to complete a specific selectable dungeon, run or instance. Note that it is not possible to queue for dungeons outside of the player's level bracket .
	The first screen players see shows the role selection toggles and the type of dungeon desired. By default, the selection is for a random dungeon of the character 
level. This can be changed via the Type dropdown botton that list all the dungeon/run/instances available for it.
	Selecting a specific dungeon or dungeons can be accomplished by choosing the very first option in the Type dropdown. The UI changes to show a list of dungeons, all 
of which are selected. To narrow the list, click the checkbox next to the category line to select/deselect all dungeons in that category. Players can also collapse 
categories of dungeons by clicking the +/- box just to the left of the category checkbox.
	
		Removing a player
	You can remove a player from the group via the "Kick Player" botton. Only the first character get this option or the one who create the lobby.

		Leaving a group
	When you join a group you got via the Group Finder you will be on Group Finder cooldown, preventing you from joining another random group for the next 30 minutes 
	(from the time you were matched with a dungeon). There are the following exceptions:
*You got kicked from the group
*The end boss of the instance has been killed
*Additionally, if you leave from a group before one of the bosses is killed, you will receive the [Group Betrayer] debuff, which will prevent you from using the Group 
Finder for 60 minutes but if you create a room you are able to use it normal.


		Notes
*The automatic teleport does not work while on a moving boat or already in a dungeon/run/instance, in "Targas", "Yewlands" , "Fairy Land" or "Underworld", or while 
dead. Once a character goes under one of those restriction, the queue automatic stop for him/her.
*Leaving a dungeon through its ordinary entrance or exit will return the player to wherever they were before, not to the outside of the dungeon.
