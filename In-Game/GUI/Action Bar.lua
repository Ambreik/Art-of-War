			Action Bar
			
	The Action Bar is the left-most part of the "Interface Bar" at the bottom of the screen, and is used as a ready source for command shortcuts (abilities or others). 
	Player may drag and drop icons into the Action Bar in order to create a customized interface. Experienced players will give great attention to the layout of their 
Action Bar(s), as it represents the primary means of interface in combat, and is critical in allowing for quick action in an environment where 1–3 seconds delay can 
mean the difference between victory or a wipe.

	This bar contain the "Action Bar UI" with slots for skills, counted in the left side of the bar from "SLOT 1" to "SLOT 0" (1-0 bottons) where skills must be 
dragged from the "Skill UI" page. Also, in these slots, you can put the icons of some actions or the seals of pets or mounts or the horse. You can also add potions, 
liquors or runes. Not all runes can be attached here to be used as "Shortcut" from inventory.
	To the right of the command shortcuts are gold up (↑) and down (↓) arrows to switch to alternate Action Bars. There are 4 such rows in total.
	
	Above the "Action Bar UI" there are 4 other bottons and are usually used for certain skills such as "Ultimate Skill" or "Pet/Mount" seal, for an easy or fast 
summon. To easy switch between those bars use the cursor of the mouse to do so or press down "ALT" to swam temporary to the second bar as usually does not need more 
than two lines for a whole pack of skills to be used in normal circumstances.
