			Zarian, Master of Lockpicking

	Location : Zarian resides in a secluded area just outside the "Alaban" settlement, a region known for its outlaw presence. His dwelling is hidden deep within the 
"The Southern Woods" area, a shadowy forest that borders the "Alaban" village. This area is filled with old ruins, broken locks, and forgotten treasures, perfect for 
a master lockpicker like Zarian. The path to his home is often tricky to navigate, requiring those seeking his expertise to solve a few basic traps before they can 
gain entry. A small, dimly lit cabin with a stonework exterior stands hidden among trees and foliage, with secret compartments and locked doors at every turn.

	Appearance : Zarian is a wiry figure with sharp features, his hands well-practiced in the fine art of lockpicking. His attire consists of dark, flexible leather 
armor that allows him to move easily in tight spaces. He carries an array of small, intricate tools used for his craft. His eyes, sharp and calculating, constantly 
scan his surroundings, always looking for the next challenge.

	Role : Zarian is a key NPC for "Outlaws" who wish to advance their pickpocketing skill. He provides access to unlock "Junkboxes" and other locked containers, 
often for a fee or in exchange for a favor. He offers guidance on how to increase one’s proficiency in picking pockets, as well as unlocking more advanced boxes.

	Personality : Zarian is an enigmatic figure with a cryptic sense of humor. He enjoys speaking in riddles and offering advice that often leaves listeners with more
questions than answers. Though a recluse, he is highly respected by those who know him for his unparalleled skills in lockpicking.

	Dialogue :
	- When first approached : "Ah, I see you've come seeking my expertise. Lockpicking is an art, my friend, and not everyone is cut out for it. But if you're serious, I might just have something for you."
	- When asked for help with Junkboxes : "Junkboxes, eh? You've been busy, I see. I can open them for you, but be warned—every box has its secrets. Are you sure you're ready to face what lies inside?"
	- When the player reaches Artisan rank : "Impressive, Artisan. You've become a true master of your craft. But remember, even the best can be outwitted. Stay sharp, and never underestimate a locked door."
