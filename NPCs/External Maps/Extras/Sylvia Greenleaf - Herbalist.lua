			Sylvia Greenleaf

	Location : Anjan's Green Stable (Stable & Blacksmith Area)

---

	Appearance : Sylvia is a slender woman in her early thirties, with long, dark green hair tied loosely in a braid, which occasionally flutters with the wind. She
wears simple, earth-toned clothing made from natural fibers, along with a large leather pouch filled with herbs and potions strapped around her waist. Her hands are
always stained with plant sap, a result of her constant work in mixing remedies. Her eyes are bright, an emerald green that seems to reflect the surrounding forest,
and her skin carries a slight tan from hours spent outdoors. Her gentle smile and the soft expression on her face give her an approachable, calming presence.

	Personality : Sylvia is kind-hearted and deeply attuned to nature. She speaks in a soft, melodic voice, often offering advice or wisdom about the plants and 
herbs around her. She has a peaceful demeanor and is quick to offer help to those in need. While she is always ready to offer information on healing and herbs, she 
also loves to tell stories of her adventures in the wild, where she learned the secrets of the plants she works with. She may come off as dreamy at times, often 
getting lost in thought about the plants and their healing properties, but she is reliable and caring, always willing to lend a hand to those in need.

	Behaviour : Sylvia tends to stay close to the herbalist's table or just outside the stable, where she tends to her small garden of healing plants. She is most 
often seen carefully selecting herbs, mixing potions, or inspecting her plants for signs of disease. When approached by players, she will often greet them warmly 
and offer them advice on what remedies might help them in their travels. She has an innate curiosity about nature and will occasionally ask players to bring her 
rare plants from their adventures, offering rewards in return for their efforts.
