			Roran Ironhand

	Location : Anjan's Green Stable (Stable & Blacksmith Area)

	Appearance : Roran is a towering, broad-shouldered man, his skin darkened from years of working the forge. His muscles are thick and solid, built from years of 
shaping metal. His hair is short and black, with a few streaks of gray at the temples, and his thick beard is neatly trimmed. His face is often streaked with soot, 
but his deep brown eyes gleam with warmth and skill. He wears a well-worn leather apron over a sturdy tunic, both of which are adorned with burns and patches from 
his many years of blacksmithing. His hands are large and calloused, with scars that tell the story of his craft.

	Personality : Roran is a no-nonsense, serious man, but beneath his gruff exterior lies a deep pride in his work. He speaks with a low, gravelly voice, often 
offering blunt but wise advice to those who seek his expertise. Though he is not quick to smile, when he does, it’s clear that he takes immense pride in his craft 
and the quality of his work. He has little patience for those who don't respect the value of hard work, but he is always willing to lend his skills to those who 
are earnest and respectful. Roran takes great care in every piece he forges, and it shows in the strength and precision of his weapons and armor.

	Behaviour : Roran is typically found at his anvil, hammering away at the latest piece of armor or weapon. He occasionally pauses to inspect his work, wiping the
sweat from his brow before returning to his craft. When players approach, he will look them over, sizing them up before speaking. His interactions are often short 
and to the point, but if a player shows genuine interest in his craft, he may offer tips on forging or suggest items to craft.
