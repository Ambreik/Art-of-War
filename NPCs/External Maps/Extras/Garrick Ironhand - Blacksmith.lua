			Garrick Ironhand

	Location : Hammerfall Forge, Ironclad Keep

---

	Appearance : Garrick is a large, muscular dwarf with a thick, braided beard and a furrowed brow. His skin is weathered from years spent in the forge, tanned by 
the heat of the fires he works with. He wears a heavy leather apron, blackened from soot, over his rugged, metal-armored attire. His arms are covered in tattoos of 
ancient blacksmithing symbols and runes, some glowing faintly with a magical aura. Garrick’s hands are rough and calloused from wielding hammer and anvil for 
decades. His eyes, a deep amber color, are sharp and filled with a quiet intensity as he works, never losing focus on his craft. He carries a large, enchanted 
warhammer that has seen many battles.

	Personality : Garrick is gruff and serious, rarely showing any signs of humor or small talk. His focus is entirely on his craft, and he expects nothing less 
than perfection from both himself and others. Though he may appear intimidating at first, those who prove themselves capable of hard work and dedication quickly 
earn his respect. Garrick has a deep love for the art of blacksmithing and can often be found muttering to himself about the proper balance of metal and fire. He 
has little patience for idle chatter, but if approached with respect and a willingness to learn, he will offer advice on crafting, metallurgy, and even combat 
strategy.

	Behaviour : Garrick is often seen at his forge, hammering away at weapons or armor, his brow dripping with sweat. When players approach, he looks them over 
before offering a brief nod, sometimes acknowledging them with a grunt of approval. He works quickly and with intense focus, never pausing unless interrupted. 
Garrick will sometimes critique the quality of weapons or armor brought to him by players, offering them a chance to improve their own craftsmanship. He is 
meticulous, ensuring that any work he oversees is of the highest standard.
