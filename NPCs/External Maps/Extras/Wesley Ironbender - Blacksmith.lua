			Wesley Ironbender

	Location : Anjan's Green Stable (Stable & Blacksmith Area)

---

	Appearance : Wesley is a burly man in his mid-forties with a thick beard that reaches down to his chest, streaked with hints of silver. His hands are calloused 
and stained with soot from years of working the forge. He wears a sturdy blacksmith’s apron over a simple tunic, and his arms are covered in scars from close calls 
with his forge. His dark brown hair is pulled back into a loose ponytail, revealing a weathered face that shows both his age and experience. His eyes, a dull amber,
are focused with an intensity that speaks of years spent mastering the art of smithing.

	Personality : Wesley is direct and no-nonsense, often speaking in a gruff tone. However, beneath his rough exterior lies a deep respect for quality 
craftsmanship, and he takes great pride in his work. He has a dry sense of humor, often making wry comments about the quality of his apprentices' work or the state 
of their gear. While he’s not particularly warm or outgoing, those who take the time to speak with him find a man who values honesty and dedication. He is not one 
for flowery speech, but he has an unwavering loyalty to those he trusts.

	Behaviour : Wesley is usually found at his anvil, hammering away at metal. He has a strict routine and tends to work well into the night. When approached, he’ll
often give a nod of acknowledgment before returning to his work, only engaging in conversation when it’s absolutely necessary. He’s not one to chase after idle 
chatter, but when someone expresses genuine interest in smithing, he’ll gladly share his knowledge and techniques. He often grumbles when asked about taking a break
but will begrudgingly comply if it means offering advice to someone willing to learn.

	Quotes:  
- "You want something forged right? Then you’d better get out of my way and let me work."
- "Not everything that’s shiny is worth your time, kid. You’ve got to know your metal before you make a weapon out of it."
- "I can tell you’ve got the right stuff, but do you have the patience? This forge isn’t kind to those who rush."
- "Don’t get too attached to what I’m making. It’s just metal until it’s in your hands. But when it’s in your hands... that’s when it matters."
- "I’ve been at this for decades. You think a little fire’s gonna scare me off? Ha, you’ve got a lot to learn."
- "You need a new sword? Or are you looking for something a bit... stronger? I can make anything if the metal’s right."
- "You’ll find me at my anvil, as always. No need to shout. Just bring me what you’ve got, and we’ll see if it’s worth working with."
- "Sometimes, the best tools come from the simplest materials. But you won’t know until you try."
