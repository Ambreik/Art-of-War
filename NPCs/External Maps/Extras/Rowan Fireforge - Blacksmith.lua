			Rowan Fireforge

	Location : Anjan's Green Stable (Stable & Blacksmith Area)

---

	Appearance : Rowan is a tall, broad-shouldered woman in her late twenties, with fiery red hair that she keeps tied back in a practical ponytail. Her complexion 
is tanned from years of outdoor adventuring, and her sharp green eyes always seem to be scanning her surroundings. She wears sturdy leather armor, well-worn from 
battle, with several small trinkets tied to her belt—tokens of her past adventures. A small hammer, hanging from her side, suggests she’s more than just an 
adventurer, with an expertise in blacksmithing and crafting. Despite her rugged appearance, there’s a warmth in her smile when she speaks to others.

	Personality : Rowan is straightforward, confident, and has a no-nonsense attitude. She speaks with a tone of authority, but she’s also fiercely protective of 
those she considers friends. Her dry humor often comes through in her words, and while she can be blunt, her actions reveal her loyalty to her comrades. Rowan is 
the type of adventurer who thrives in the face of danger but also enjoys the simple moments of peace—like a drink in a tavern or telling stories around a campfire.

---

	Behaviour : Rowan is often found standing near the stable, keeping an eye out for trouble or helping with the maintenance of gear and weapons. She’s usually 
quick to offer advice to those in need, but she doesn’t waste time on pleasantries. When approached, she’ll either offer a gruff greeting or dive straight into 
business, depending on her mood.
