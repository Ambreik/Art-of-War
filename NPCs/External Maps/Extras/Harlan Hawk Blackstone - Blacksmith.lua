	Appearance : Harlan is a man in his mid-thirties with a lean, athletic build and a weathered face that tells of many years spent in the wilderness. His hair is 
dark and unkempt, with a few streaks of gray starting to show at the temples. A pair of sharp blue eyes, constantly scanning his surroundings, give him a hawk-like 
appearance, hence his nickname. He wears a mix of practical leather and fur, perfect for surviving in harsh environments. A longbow is slung across his back, along 
with a quiver of arrows, though he also carries a short blade at his waist. A scar runs down the left side of his face, a reminder of a close call during one of his
adventures.
