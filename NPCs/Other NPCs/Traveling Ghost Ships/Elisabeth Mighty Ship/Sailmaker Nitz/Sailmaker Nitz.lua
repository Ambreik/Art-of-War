			Sailmaker Nitz
			
	"Nitz" is a seasoned sailmaker with a no-nonsense demeanor and a knack for precision in her craft. Her sturdy frame and keen eyes make her well-suited for the 
demands of the job. Always seen with a pouch of tools at her side, Nitz spends her time before departures carefully inspecting every sail for wear or damage. When the
"Elisabeth Mighty Ship" sets sail, Nitz relaxes a bit but remains alert, often enjoying a quiet drink on the deck where she can monitor the sails from afar. With 
years of experience, she has an intuitive sense for even the slightest change in wind patterns or sail tension, alerting the crew to potential issues long before they
become problematic.

	"Sailmaker Nitz" is an older, grizzled NPC with a lifetime of seafaring experience etched into his features. Known for his rugged hands and keen eye, Nitz is the 
kind of character who can spot a fraying line or weak patch of canvas from across the deck. His clothes are simple, typically stained with oil and salt, reflecting 
his hands-on, hardworking nature. Nitz spends much of his time on the ship’s upper decks, carefully inspecting the sails and rigging, meticulously checking for any 
signs of wear and tear.

	As a meticulous and somewhat reserved character, Nitz rarely engages in casual conversation but commands a strong presence among the crew. His knowledge of 
sailmaking borders on an art form; he can feel changes in the tension of the sail by touch alone, and he takes pride in his craftsmanship. He doesn’t interact with 
players often but might share a brief nod or a simple word of advice about the ship’s upkeep when approached.

	In his downtime, Nitz can be found leaning against the railing with a small, well-worn flask, gazing at the horizon with an intense expression. His dedication to 
the ship is evident in every sail he mends and every knot he ties, ensuring that the Elisabeth Mighty Ship remains seaworthy on even the harshest voyages.
