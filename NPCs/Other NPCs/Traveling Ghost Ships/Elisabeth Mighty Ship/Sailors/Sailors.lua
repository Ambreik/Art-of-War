			Sailors
	
	The "Sailors" on the "Elisabeth Mighty Ship" are a dynamic group of eight NPCs, each dedicated to essential duties on deck, collectively creating a bustling, 
lively atmosphere. These sailors represent a diverse mix of characters, each with distinct personalities and backgrounds, adding to the richness of the ship's 
environment. While they are not central to quests or direct story progression, they serve as interactive background characters that bring the ship to life and offer 
an immersive, authentic feel of a voyage at sea.

	Each sailor has a unique role:

	1. "The Bosun’s Mate" - This character oversees maintenance and assists in navigating the deck, ensuring ropes and pulleys are in order. Recognizable by their 
loud, rallying voice, they often motivate other sailors with commands and encouragement.
	2. "The Lookout" - Positioned near the ship’s mast, the lookout is an alert NPC with a keen sense of observation, constantly scanning the horizon. Occasionally, 
players might catch the lookout calling out weather changes or distant objects, enhancing the sense of adventure.
	3. "The Deckhand Duo" - This pair of sailors is often seen working together on minor repairs, coiling ropes, and handling general upkeep. They share jokes, 
exchange sea shanties, and provide a lighthearted vibe, making them a notable presence on the ship.
	4. "The Cook’s Assistant" - A sailor who doubles as the cook’s helper, bringing ingredients to and from the galley. Friendly and chatty, this NPC often shares 
tales about food shortages or odd ingredients they’ve cooked in past voyages, adding a humorous touch to the journey.
	5. "The Night Watch" - This sailor is typically quiet, responsible for night shifts or early morning duties. Often seen cleaning the deck at dawn, they embody a 
sense of duty and resilience.
	6. "The Rigger" - A nimble sailor who climbs the masts to adjust sails, the rigger is agile and slightly daring, often seen balancing on ropes or making quick 
repairs high above. They occasionally exchange nods with players who observe them in action, adding an element of respect and admiration.
	7. "The Storyteller" - Known for their tall tales and wild stories of past journeys, the storyteller sailor is always ready to entertain the crew and players with
exaggerated tales of sea monsters and hidden treasures. This character is approachable and serves as a source of lore for curious players.
	8. "The Newcomer" - A young, somewhat inexperienced sailor trying to fit in among the more seasoned crew members. This NPC is seen struggling with tasks 
occasionally, adding a sense of realism and a glimpse into the life of a new sailor.

	As the ship nears its destination, these sailors gradually disappear from the deck, adding to the atmosphere of a bustling, efficient crew preparing for arrival. 
Their presence during the journey helps create an immersive experience, portraying the hard work and camaraderie involved in a sea voyage.
