			Sailmaker Pros
	"Pro"s is "Nitz’s" younger partner, a vibrant and cheerful presence who balances her seriousness with humor and a keen eye for detail. Known for his love of 
storytelling, "Pros" is often found entertaining the crew with tales from various ports. However, he is just as dedicated to his craft, frequently double-checking "Nitz’s" inspections or adding finishing touches. His approach to sailmaking is as meticulous as his partner’s, though he brings an experimental flair, suggesting 
small innovations or adjustments to improve performance. When off-duty, "Pros" joins "Nitz" for a drink on deck, keeping a watchful eye on the sails while sharing 
laughter and camaraderie.

	"Sailmaker Pros" is a robust, friendly NPC whose laid-back demeanor balances well with his focus on duty. Often found laughing or sharing stories with the crew on
the deck, Pros is a contrasting presence to his quieter partner, Nitz. He brings a lively energy to the ship, often weaving tales of past adventures as he works on 
the sails. His attire is colorful and slightly worn, with patches marking where he’s mended his own clothes—a nod to his dedication to both practicality and 
personality.

	"Pros" handles the routine sail maintenance with ease, confidently navigating between ropes and adjusting tension with practiced skill. He’s got a sharp eye for 
detail, able to catch even the smallest frays, but he is also known for experimenting with unconventional stitching techniques that lend added strength to the sails. 
Despite his casual nature, Pros takes pride in his work and is quick to dive into action should any storm or rough seas put the ship’s rigging to the test.

	He’s approachable and enjoys sharing a drink or friendly advice with players who approach him, occasionally recounting tips about life at sea or humorous 
observations about the ship’s quirks. While he doesn’t offer quests, his personality makes him a memorable fixture of the Elisabeth Mighty Ship, a friendly face 
players may come to look for during their voyages.
