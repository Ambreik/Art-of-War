			Captainess Marry Lebrande
			
	Captainess Marry Lebrande stands as a striking figure on the docks, embodying the spirit of adventure and authority. She is clad in fitted black pants adorned 
with various pockets, practical for her seafaring lifestyle. Her voluminous chest is elegantly covered by a white shirt with a daring neckline, hinting at her bold 
personality. Over this, she wears a distinguished blue jacket, richly embroidered in red patterns, showcasing her rank and the heritage of the legendary "Swordfish 
Fleet." The back of her jacket proudly displays the fleet's emblem, a testament to their renowned speed and prowess in both neutralizing threats and executing 
daring rescues. Adorning her shoulders are additional decorations, signifying her achievements and status among sailors. 
	In her hands, she often twirls a pirate spade, a playful gesture that reflects her charismatic nature. Although she carries two small flintlock pistols at her 
sides, they remain holstered and unused, adding an air of mystery to her character. Players often speculate about their purpose, as they have never witnessed her draw them in action.
	Captainess Lebrande is known for her friendly demeanor, making her approachable to players seeking adventure. She possesses a keen sense of leadership, 
occasionally issuing commands to players who find themselves isolated at that time. When players heed her advice and follow her orders, they are rewarded with 
unique bonuses or items, enhancing their gameplay experience. These interactions are rare and typically occur through mission windows in the player interface, 
making them special moments for those fortunate enough to engage with her.
