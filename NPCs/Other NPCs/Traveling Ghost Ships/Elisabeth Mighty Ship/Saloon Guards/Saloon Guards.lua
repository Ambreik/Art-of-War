			Saloon Guards

		Saloon Guards Overview
	The saloon guards are a cohesive team responsible for enforcing order within "Elisabeth’s" bustling saloon. Each of these five guards has distinct 
characteristics, specialized combat abilities, and a set of mechanics that help them manage crowd control, break up fights, and protect patrons and staff alike. 
They act as a protective barrier against unruly behavior and possess specialized skills that reflect both their training and individual personalities.

	1. Arlo “Ironfist” Marsten  
- Role : The Lead Guard

	5. Jarek “Hawkeye” Thorne  
- Role : The Watchful Overseer
- Description : Jarek, an ex-scout, has sharp eyes and an unmatched perception. He spots trouble before it starts, alerting the team to potential threats.
- Skills :
	- Eagle Eye : Scans the area, highlighting suspicious individuals for the rest of the team to monitor, giving them an awareness buff.
	- Disabling Shot : Uses a non-lethal dart to temporarily disable an aggressor, giving the team time to intervene.
- Mechanics : Jarek gains "Focus Points (FP)", built up over time as he remains in a surveillance mode. The higher his FP, the more targets he can mark with 
"Eagle Eye", improving the team’s readiness for sudden threats.

		Advanced Guard Mechanics
- Cooperative Mechanics : The guards have a "Unity Meter" that fills as they assist each other in subduing threats. A high Unity Meter unlocks "Team Cohesion", 
boosting each guard's primary skill effectiveness by 20% and providing faster cooldowns.
Here are some mechanics for the Saloon Guards on the *Elisabeth Mighty Ship*:

	Player Inspection
- Routine Check : The guards periodically survey the saloon, inspecting each player’s behavior, attire, and visible weapons. If players exhibit suspicious behavior or are known troublemakers, guards initiate a "Closer Inspection", where they engage the player, asking about their purpose or intentions. 
- Identification Challenge : Occasionally, guards may challenge players to present proof of ship passage or an ID item. Players without valid items are warned and may be escorted out of the saloon or detained if multiple infractions occur.

-Dispute Intervention 
	- Proximity Alert : When a fight breaks out within their sight or hearing range, guards move to break it up, targeting the primary instigator or whoever seems 
to be escalating the conflict. Guards attempt to de-escalate the situation verbally first, but if fighting continues, they apply their crowd-control abilities to 
separate the combatants.
	- Deterrence Moves : Guards may use non-lethal techniques, such as temporary stun abilities or disarming tactics, specifically aimed at cooling down tensions #
without lasting harm to players. Once the situation is under control, they impose short-term penalties on players who continued to engage, such as reduced movement 
speed or a "Cool-Off Period" debuff, which limits aggressive actions temporarily.

-Backup Call System
	- On-Call Response : When situations exceed their individual control, any guard can signal for backup. This results in additional guards arriving to reinforce 
control or separate larger groups involved in the disturbance. Players engaging multiple guards simultaneously will face stacking deterrents, such as a 
"Locked Target" debuff that decreases offensive capabilities against guards.
	- Group Restrain : If a player resists or disrupts the saloon multiple times, the guards activate a synchronized move called "Circle Lock", a formation that 
restricts the player’s movements, disabling combat and forcing them into a restrained state until they comply or leave.

	Each of these mechanics would allow the guards to manage the saloon environment and keep interactions immersive, maintaining both the safety and order on board 
the "Elisabeth Mighty Ship". Let me know if you'd like to expand on any of these mechanics further!
