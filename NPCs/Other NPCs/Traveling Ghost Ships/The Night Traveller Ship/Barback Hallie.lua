		Tricks to the costumers
1. Scarcity Tactics: Creating a sense of urgency by indicating that a product is in limited supply or that a sale is ending soon. This can prompt customers to make 
quicker purchasing decisions.
2. Anchoring: Presenting a higher-priced item first to make subsequent items seem more reasonably priced. This can influence customers' perceptions of value.
3. Bundling: Offering products together at a discounted rate compared to purchasing them separately. This can encourage customers to buy more than they initially 
intended.
4. Free Trials: Allowing customers to try a product or service for free for a limited time, which can lead to conversions once they experience the benefits. Those 
drinks taste bad and sometimes have the effect of confusion (making the player screen to act as he was drunk).
