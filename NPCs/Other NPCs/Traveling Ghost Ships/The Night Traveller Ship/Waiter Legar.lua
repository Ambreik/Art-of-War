			Waiter Legar
			
	"Waiter Legar" is a unique and intriguing member of the pirate crew aboard the ship alongside his fellow waiter, "Waiter Squid". Unlike "Squid", who embodies a 
more whimsical and eccentric demeanor, "Legar" presents a more human appearance, albeit one that is marked by the ravages of time and misfortune. His body is decayed,
a testament to the harsh realities of life at sea and the curses that haunt their crew. "Legar" has lost one arm and is missing a leg from the knee down, which he 
compensates for with a sturdy wooden prosthetic that he navigates with surprising agility.
	Despite his physical condition, "Legar" shares the same jovial and mischievous personality as "Waiter Squid". He is known for his quick wit and humor, often 
lightening the mood among the crew and costumers with his unique brand of jokes. "Legar" has a repertoire of ten original jokes that he delivers with flair, each one 
designed to elicit laughter even in the direst of situations. In addition to his humor, he challenges his shipmates with two hard riddles, offering rewards to those 
who can solve them. These riddles not only serve as entertainment but also as a means to foster camaraderie among the crew.

	Legar is not just a source of laughter; he also harbors a deep-seated quest that drives him. He seeks brave souls willing to embark on a perilous adventure to 
"Dragon Isle", a treacherous land shrouded in mystery and danger. The island is home to a fearsome beast that cursed "Legar" and his comrades, transforming them into 
the undead. This quest is not merely a personal vendetta; it is a chance for redemption and liberation from the curse that binds them. Those who accept "Legar's" 
quest will find themselves on a thrilling journey filled with challenges, danger, and the promise of glory.

	In summary, "Waiter Legar" is a compelling character whose blend of humor, resilience, and determination makes him an invaluable member of the pirate crew. His 
quest for vengeance against the beast on "Dragon Isle" adds depth to his character, making him a figure of both laughter and intrigue among his fellow pirates.

	He also drink rum especially when his captain come along, time when he may become drunk and start throwing empty bottles to the players.
	Can interact with him for jokes or riddles but also he is a "SHOP" who can sell different beverages or quest giver. Quests he will offer only when he is drunk 
with a low chance.
