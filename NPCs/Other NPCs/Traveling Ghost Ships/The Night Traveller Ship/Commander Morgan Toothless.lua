			Commander Morgan Toothless
			
	"Commander Morgan Toothless", now transformed into a zombie, presents a haunting yet intriguing figure. His once robust build has become gaunt, with a pallid 
complexion that highlights the decay of his former self. His skin is a mottled gray, with patches of greenish hues, giving him an eerie, undead appearance. The 
absence of teeth is even more pronounced now, with his mouth often hanging slightly open, revealing darkened gums and a menacing, vacant stare.
	In terms of costume, his military uniform has deteriorated significantly. The dark blue fabric is tattered and stained, with frayed edges and visible signs of 
wear from his time as a zombie. The silver insignia that once gleamed proudly is now dulled and tarnished,barely recognizable against the backdrop of grime and decay.
The jacket hangs loosely on his skeletal frame, and the utility belt is partially broken, with tools and gadgets either missing or rusted beyond use. His boots, once 
sturdy and polished, are now scuffed and caked with dirt,reflecting his new, aimless wandering. The distinctive cap he used to wear is askew, with a few ragged holes,
adding to his disheveled look.
	Despite his ghastly transformation, remnants of his former personality linger. Thereâ€™s a flicker of recognition in his eyes, hinting at the strategic mind that 
once guided his actions. However, the humor and camaraderie he once shared with his crew have been replaced by a haunting silence, making him a tragic figure in this 
new, undead existence. As a zombie, "Commander Morgan Toothless" embodies the loss of his former self, caught between the memories of his past life and the grim 
reality of his current state.

	He is only seen along side "Captain Rock, White Beard" when they are coming to the lounge to have a drink. 
	Cannot interact with him, only during a chain-quest that start in "Highland Island".
