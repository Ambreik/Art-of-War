			Captain Rock, White Beard
			
	"Captain Rock, White Beard", stands as a formidable figure on the deck of his ship, the Crusader's Wrath. His once-proud stature is now a haunting silhouette 
against the moonlit sky. His long, flowing white beard, a remnant of his former glory, is tangled and matted, giving him an eerie appearance. His skin, once sun-
kissed and rugged from years at sea, has taken on a pallid hue, revealing the decay that accompanies his cursed existence.
	His eyes, once bright with the spirit of adventure, now glow with an unsettling, ghostly light, hinting at the torment of his undead state. He wears a tattered 
naval coat adorned with remnants of his past rank, the gold epaulettes now dulled and tarnished. A wide-brimmed hat, once a symbol of authority, sits crookedly atop 
his head, casting shadows over his skeletal features.
	Captain Rock's hands, now skeletal and bony, grip a weathered cutlass, its blade stained with the memories of countless battles. His boots, once polished and 
proud, are now worn and frayed, echoing the years spent in hiding and piracy. Despite his ghastly appearance, there remains an air of command about him, a lingering echo of the great leader he once was.

		Short Story: The Curse of "Captain Rock, White Beard"

	In the heart of the tumultuous seas, where the waves crashed against the jagged cliffs of the Middlean Islands, a legend was born. Captain Rock, once a revered
commander in the human marine army, had turned his back on honor and duty during the infamous siege of "Lagooma Jungle" territories. Betrayal coursed through his 
veins as he seized the opportunity to escape with fifty loyal crew members aboard a precious crusader ship, the "Crusader's Wrath".
	For years, they thrived in the shadows of the islands, embracing the life of piracy. Under "Captain Rock's" fierce leadership, they became notorious for raiding 
merchant vessels and seizing military equipment, their names whispered in fear across the seas. But the thrill of their newfound freedom came at a cost. As the war 
raged on, dark creatures emerged from the depths of the jungle of "Dragon Isle", capturing the crew and dragging them into the abyss. In the midst of a fierce battle 
for survival, a curse was unleashed upon them —a dark magic that transformed "Captain Rock" and his remaining crew into wretched beings, neither alive nor dead.
	Now, as the moon hung high in the sky, casting an eerie glow over the cursed crew, "Captain Rock" stood at the helm of the "Crusader's Wrath", a ship that had 
become a ghostly vessel of despair. His crew, once vibrant men, were now a ghastly sight—some reduced to mere bones, others with flesh hanging loosely from their 
decaying forms and some of hem having limbs of aquatic animals.

	He is always on the docks where players are greet by him, asking for the payment to step on his ship. After the ship departure, he can be seen over the windows of
his cabin, walking on the back deck of the ship or sometimes in the saloon where he drink a cup of rum and dissapear before step over the doors of the lounge.
	During his presence in the lounge, can interact with him, asking only a few questions such as : 
*What is the story of your life !
*There are better days now ?
*Do you have secrets that can be shared with me?
*It is worth it to betray by position and follow the pirates in the far east of "Frozen Territories" ?
	He is a skillable NPC but rarely interact in any duel, usually just walk away from those activities when happend. If he instead stay and fight, all players can 
attack him and everyone who can survive 30 seconds in a combat with him, is rewarded with "Coin of Trespasser" item that is used to have access to this ship travel 
without any other payment. In case of any player who can stand more than 2 minutes, he is rewarded with "Mysterious Chest" and title of "Beater of the Pirates".
