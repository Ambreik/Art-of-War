			First Mate Bran Thorne**

	Appearance : First Mate Bran Thorne is a broad-shouldered man with a rugged face that speaks of long years spent on the open sea. His salt-and-pepper hair is 
typically tied back in a neat ponytail, with a short, scruffy beard framing a stern but approachable face. His piercing blue eyes, set beneath bushy brows, have the
keen, observant look of a man who misses no detail. Bran's attire consists of a worn, heavy leather coat, sea-stained trousers, and a belt loaded with useful 
tools. His hands are calloused from handling the ropes and rigging, and he moves with the sure, steady gait of someone deeply at home on the deck of a ship.

	Personality : Reliable, even-tempered, and respected, Bran is known for his skill in navigation and ship maintenance, as well as his loyalty to the crew. He has
a no-nonsense attitude toward work but lightens up in the saloon, where he enjoys sharing a drink and a story or two with trusted friends and passengers. Though 
he’s strict with the crew, he’s fair-minded and believes in second chances, except when loyalty is broken. Bran takes great pride in his heritage, seeing himself as
part of a lineage of sailors and fighters. A man with a wry sense of humor, Bran also appreciates the practical skills needed to survive, especially herbalism, 
which he’s come to regard as invaluable.

		Stories

	1. "Echoes of the Second Great War"
	Bran Thorne often speaks with a reverence that sharpens when he shares the stories passed down from his family, especially tales of his ancestor who fought in 
the famed "Second Great War" on the continent of "Zonen". This war, a colossal conflict involving gods, mortals, and creatures from both realms, etched scars into 
the lands and reshaped the fate of civilizations.

His ancestor, a young sailor then, was thrust into a battle unlike any other. As Bran recounts, "The skies burned with flame and fury, and the earth trembled beneath the clash of warriors and divine forces. Few walked away from the smoke and ruins that day, but those who did, carried legends in their blood." Bran’s voice
wavers as he describes the relentless determination of the soldiers who stood their ground against insurmountable odds, fighting not only for their lives but for a 
future that could endure beyond the realm of gods. He speaks of heroes who emerged from the chaos, wielding courage as their only weapon, and of the moments when 
even the strongest faltered, only to rise again.

The memory is bittersweet, and Bran often concludes this tale with a solemn warning to his listeners. "Wars may end," he says, "but their echoes linger. Those who remember, carry the wisdom of what was lost and gained. And those who forget… may yet face a greater battle ahead."

	2. "A Sailor's Love for Herbalism"
	For Bran, there is no greater profession than the art of "Herbalism". This belief, passed down like an heirloom, comes from his own years of learning the craft 
aboard the ship and in countless ports. He often begins this tale by describing how, in his younger days, his knowledge of plants and herbs was limited to 
recognizing what was edible or poisonous. But, as he explored the world’s coasts and forests, his curiosity for plants blossomed.

	One fateful day, he met a wise healer who shared with him the philosophy that Herbalism was "the quiet art of understanding the world beneath one’s feet." To 
Bran, this was no simple skill; it was a calling. He tells of nights spent in study, learning to recognize the herbs that could heal wounds, calm storm-tossed 
sailors, or even soothe the restless hearts of those who had seen too much of war and death. "Herbalism," he says with conviction, "connects us to life’s simplest truths. In every leaf and root lies a story, a remedy, a cure for the world’s ails."

	Bran’s passion for Herbalism goes beyond mere plants; he sees it as a form of respect for the earth itself, a craft as noble as any weapon or armor. His 
admiration often inspires younger sailors to seek the knowledge of herbs, hoping to understand the same mysteries Bran has come to cherish.
