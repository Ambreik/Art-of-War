			Saloon Guards

	Description : The "Saloon Guards" are a team of four skilled individuals, each with a unique role and personality, dedicated to ensuring that the saloon remains
a peaceful place for all patrons. They are never seen without each other, working as a cohesive unit to prevent disruptions, protect the guests, and restore order 
when necessary. While their appearance may be uniform, their personalities vary, providing a layer of depth to their duties. These guards take pride in maintaining 
peace, but should the need arise, they will swiftly and decisively handle any unruly behavior.

	Each guard is highly trained in both hand-to-hand combat and conflict resolution, and together they form an unyielding force capable of controlling even the 
most volatile situations. Here are the individual members of the team:

approach to maintaining order, always keeping a sharp eye on the saloon’s patrons. His calm and collected demeanor is matched by his quick decision-making in high-
pressure situations.

	Personality : Jarek is serious, efficient, and not one for idle conversation. He commands respect through his authoritative presence and expects the same from 
his team. While he rarely smiles, when he does, it’s with a sense of pride in his duty. He values structure and discipline, and he has an unshakable belief in 
fairness—he’s quick to stop a fight, but equally quick to act if someone crosses the line. end

	2. Elara "The Shield" Faelorn

	Description : Elara is the most physically imposing member of the team, a half-elf with sharp features and fiery red hair. Standing at an average height but

alert, and she moves with the grace of someone who has fought many battles.

sense of duty and is always ready to step in when things get too heated. Though she may not speak much, she is fiercely loyal to her fellow guards and enjoys making
sure that those under her protection are well taken care of. Her calm and composed nature is perfect for keeping the peace.

	3. Finnian "The Quick" Wren

	Description : Finnian, or "The Quick" as he's known, is a lithe and agile human with a mischievous grin always on his face. His dark hair is constantly 
windswept, and his eyes gleam with sharp intelligence. While smaller in stature compared to the others, Finnian is incredibly fast and can slip in and out of 
situations before most even notice. He often uses his speed to defuse potential conflicts before they escalate, darting between groups and talking down aggressive 
individuals before things get out of hand.

	Personality : Finnian has a light-hearted and charismatic personality. He’s the guard most likely to engage with patrons before anything gets out of hand. While
he takes his job seriously, he has a way of defusing tense situations with humor and charm. His quick reflexes and even quicker wit make him an asset to the team.

	4. Soraya "The Silent" Blackthorn

	Description : Soraya is the most enigmatic member of the team. A silent and reserved individual, she wears a dark cloak that blends into the shadows. With long,
raven-black hair and pale skin, she often appears as though she has emerged from the very darkness she commands. Her piercing violet eyes miss nothing, and her 
presence, though quiet, is always felt. Soraya is a master of stealth and uses her talents to keep an eye on everything that goes on in the saloon without being 
seen.

	Personality : Soraya rarely speaks, preferring to observe from the shadows. She’s a master of subtlety and is known for silently intervening in situations where
a heavy hand is not required. Her silence and calmness serve to unnerve troublemakers, as they never know when she might strike. While others are speaking and 
negotiating, Soraya is always watching, waiting for any sign of trouble. She is highly disciplined and focused, often using her skill in stealth to remove threats 
before they even realize she’s there.

		Mechanics :

- Guard Synchronization : The Saloon Guards work together seamlessly, with each member utilizing their unique abilities to handle disruptions. While Jarek commands 
the team’s movements, Elara handles physical confrontations, Finnian uses his speed to control the flow of the room, and Soraya strikes from the shadows.

- Intervention Mechanics : If a player starts fighting, the Saloon Guards will initially attempt to stop the fight using non-lethal force, such as holding down or 
disarming the player. If the situation escalates, they will use more forceful methods to subdue the troublemaker.

- Skillable NPCs : Players can engage with the Saloon Guards in combat if they choose to cause a disturbance. However, they will quickly realize that defeating the 
Saloon Guards is no easy task. Each guard has unique combat abilities based on their traits:
	- Jarek is highly resilient and has a powerful shield bash.
	- Elara excels in tanking damage and can shield others with her massive shield.
	- Finnian is quick on his feet and has abilities that allow him to stun or confuse enemies.
	- Soraya is stealthy and can strike from behind, using shadow-based abilities to confuse enemies.

- Guard Behavior : The Saloon Guards will only attack players who start a fight or cause significant trouble within the saloon. If the player stops fighting or 
obeys the guard’s orders, the guards will back off. However, if a player continuously engages in disruptive behavior, the guards will eventually escort the player 
out of the saloon.

- Peacekeeper Buff : Players who maintain peace within the saloon will receive a temporary "Peacekeeper" buff, increasing their resistance to crowd-control effects 
while in the saloon.
