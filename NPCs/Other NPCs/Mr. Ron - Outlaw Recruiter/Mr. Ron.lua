			Mr. Ron

	Mr. Ron is a charismatic yet enigmatic figure with an appearance that effortlessly blends into any crowd, making him almost ghostlike in presence. Dressed in a 
long, dark leather coat with subtle yet intricate patterns stitched along the seams, he embodies an air of mystery and confidence. His eyes,a piercing shade of amber, hold an intensity that hints at a hidden agenda and a lifetime of secrets. He is rarely seen without a dark hat that casts a shadow over his face, obscuring his expression just enough to make his intentions unreadable. 

	He speaks in a low, calm tone, with a subtle charm that makes him both likable and unsettling. His mannerisms are refined and almost aristocratic, though he’s 
always quick to laugh off any suggestion of his having noble origins. When players first meet him, he appears approachable, if a bit eccentric, always lingering just long enough to spark curiosity before disappearing into the bustling city streets.

	Though he claims to be a mere wanderer and storyteller, those who interact with Mr. Ron soon realize he knows far more about the world, its factions, and its 
secrets than he lets on. His conversations often carry a double meaning, hinting at a darker side to the existing factions and a "long-forgotten treasure" that only
a select few are worthy to seek. He carries with him an ancient tome filled with cryptic writings and lost tales, using it to pique players' interest in the Outlaw way.

	The more players speak with him, the more he hints at an alternative path and a forgotten story—a tale of betrayal, forbidden power, and a hidden city called 
Abalan. Eventually, he reveals a darker, persuasive side, offering players the chance to break free from the control of their faction to seek true freedom and 
strength. Those who accept his offer will find themselves forever marked by his teachings and bound to Abalan, where a new life as an Outlaw awaits.

	Mr. Ron can be found wandering through the main cities of both player factions on the starting continents,often choosing crowded areas like marketplaces, 
taverns, or near city gates where players naturally gather. He moves frequently to avoid drawing attention, appearing at different locations at random times, as if blending in with the city’s bustling crowds. 

	In each city, he tends to avoid the main faction headquarters and instead lingers near neutral zones—often near the edge of a bustling plaza, the shadowed 
corners of a library, or down quiet alleyways where he’s less likely to be disturbed. Despite his elusive nature, he’s a figure that players will begin to notice and recognize, creating an air of intrigue around his movements and the mystery of his agenda.

	Occasionally, he can be found in the vicinity of city bulletin boards or other places where players might take quests, subtly positioning himself as though 
simply observing the city’s happenings. Players who come across him here will often overhear him telling stories to small groups, spinning tales of forbidden paths and lost treasures, further drawing curious minds toward his offer to join the Outlaws.
