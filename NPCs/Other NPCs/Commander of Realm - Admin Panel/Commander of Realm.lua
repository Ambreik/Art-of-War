			Commander of Realm
			
	He is a male NPC, tall and slender. Blond with very light blue eyes and hair tied in a spike at the back. He has a scar on the right side of his face, like a 
notch over his right eye.
	He wears a suit made of gold plates, but without gloves and the boots are made of black leather. on the armor it has a mark like a dark red logo like some kind of
blood, which says "GM".
	In his hands he holds an open scroll, with his right hand pulling it up. You can't read what's written in that scroll, but the writing becomes like a pear of fire
once this NPC is accessible.
	As actions, he holds that parchment closed or holds it in his left hand close to his hip. Sometimes he looks at the butter and pulls that parchment with sadness.

	This NPC cannot be attacked or killed in any way. It is not a quest giver, SHOP or crafter either.	
	You can only be accessible by admins of any rank.
	
	He is present in any major settlements, usually next to the guardian of the city or in the central area.
