			Lost Merchant  

	Location : Alddan Field – Near the edge of a partially buried trade route, close to a small abandoned caravan.  

---  

	Appearance : A middle-aged merchant, covered in dust and exhaustion, sits beside a toppled wooden cart, its wheels half-buried in sand. His once lavish robes 
are now torn and sun-bleached, suggesting that he was once successful but has fallen on hard times. His grizzled beard, scarred hands, and worn-out leather satchel 
filled with old merchant records tell the story of a man who has spent years trading across dangerous lands. A small dagger hangs at his belt, but his nervous 
glances suggest he is no warrior.

	Personality : 
- Desperate & Paranoid – Constantly muttering about stolen goods and untrustworthy bandits.  
- Shrewd & Business-Oriented – Even in distress, he tries to haggle and negotiate with players, demanding fair trade for his information.  
- Distrustful of Strangers – Initially reluctant to share details, requiring players to prove their reliability before he entrusts them with his problem.  
- Superstitious – Believes the desert is "cursed" and that his bad luck is the result of disturbing something he shouldn't have.

	- Lore Entries about desert trade routes and hidden treasure locations.

- Quest Dialogue :  

   Opening :  
   > "You look like someone who’s been around these dunes before. Tell me... have you seen a group of traders recently? No? (he clenches his fists) Damn it all... my whole shipment—gone. You’re not with them, are you? Bah, never mind. Look, if you can help me, I’ll make it worth your time."  

   Mid-Quest (after finding clues) :  
   > "So they took the ledger too? That means they know where the rest of the goods are... I knew those bastards were smarter than they looked. If we hurry, we might still recover something before the sands bury it forever."  

   Completion (if returning the items) :  
   > "By the gods, you found them! I... I don’t know what to say. I thought everything was lost. Here, take this—it's not much, but it’s all I can offer. Maybe someday I’ll be back in business again... maybe."  

   Completion (if the player keeps the stolen goods instead) :  
   > "I see how it is. Can’t say I blame you. The desert has a way of making everyone a thief. Just remember—what’s taken can always be taken back." (He glares at you before turning away.)  

- Additional Notes :  
   - If the player betrays him, he may later hire bounty hunters to track them down.  
   - If the player helps him, he may become a future merchant in a desert city.

	Quotes : 
- "The desert takes more than it gives... but sometimes, it hides things even the gods forgot about."  
- "They didn’t just steal my goods. They stole my future. You ever had your future taken from you?"  
- "You trust too easily. That’s how I ended up in this mess."  
- "Everything in the desert moves—except debts. Debts stay forever."
