	Appearance : Kaelen is a middle-aged man with a weathered but charismatic appearance. He has long, silver hair that flows loosely over his 
shoulders, and his face carries a thoughtful expression, as if constantly lost in the world of his music. He wears a simple yet elegant tunic, adorned
with small musical notes embroidered in gold. Around his neck, a lute rests, and his hands are often seen strumming the strings while his eyes remain 
closed in deep concentration. His posture is relaxed but poised, with a certain air of mystery surrounding him.

	Personality : Kaelen is a gentle soul with a deep reverence for the past and a natural storytelling charm. He is soft-spoken and thoughtful, but 
when he speaks of the Ancient Ruins or sings his ballads, there’s an intense passion in his voice. He’s approachable, always eager to share his tales 
with anyone who will listen, yet there’s a melancholic undertone to his words—perhaps a reflection of the tragic themes in his songs. Despite this, 
Kaelen exudes warmth and encourages adventurers to embrace the stories of old, seeking knowledge in the world’s forgotten places.
