			Apprentice Liora Vayne  

	Location : Alddan Field – Temporary Excavation Site  

---  

	Appearance : A young woman in her early 20s, with short auburn hair tied in a messy bun, strands often escaping as she works. Her bright green eyes are filled 
with curiosity, and her lightly freckled face is usually smudged with dirt. She wears a simple linen tunic under a sturdy leather vest, with a tool belt around her 
waist holding brushes, chisels, and small excavation instruments. Her knee-high boots are covered in dust, showing she spends more time in the field than anywhere 
else. She carries a satchel with excavation notes and a small journal where she sketches findings.  

---  

	Personality : Liora is energetic, eager to learn, and sometimes a bit reckless in her enthusiasm for discovery. She admires Professor Whitlock but often 
struggles to meet his strict standards, leading to moments of frustration. She is friendly and talkative with players, always excited to share theories or discuss 
relics. However, she gets impatient with those who dismiss archaeology as just "digging up old things."
