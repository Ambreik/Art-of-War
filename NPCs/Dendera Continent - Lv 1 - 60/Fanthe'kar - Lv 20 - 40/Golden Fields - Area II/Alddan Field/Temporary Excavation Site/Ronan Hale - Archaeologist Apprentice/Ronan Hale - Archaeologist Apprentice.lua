			Ronan Hale  

	Location : Alddan Field – Archaeologist Camp  

---  

	Appearance : Ronan is a rugged man in his late 30s, with tanned skin from years spent under the sun. His short, unkempt brown hair is streaked with hints of 
gray, and a light stubble lines his jaw. Unlike his scholarly peers, he wears a reinforced leather vest over a linen shirt, favoring durability over refinement. His
gloves are thick and worn from handling tools, and a large belt pouch filled with excavation gear hangs at his waist. Scars across his arms and a chipped shovel 
slung over his back hint at a past filled with danger and adventure.  

---  

	Personality : Blunt, practical, and impatient with theoretical discussions, Ronan is a man of action. He believes history should be preserved, but not at the 
cost of efficiency. He is willing to break through walls, dig through unstable ground, and take risks if it means uncovering something significant. He often clashes
with "Liora Vayne" over methodology, dismissing her cautious approach as "wasted time." Despite this, he has a deep respect for "Professor Whitlock", though he 
rarely admits it aloud.  

---  

	Behavior :  
- Often seen sharpening tools or repairing digging equipment.  
- Frequently sighs or grumbles when Liora insists on slow, careful excavation.  
- Occasionally tells stories of his past as a treasure hunter, often exaggerating his exploits.  
- Will inspect player gear and make comments about their durability.

	Role :  
-  Role(s) : Archaeologist Apprentice, Excavation Expert  
	- Assists in excavation efforts, offering players guidance on how to properly dig, analyze structures, and identify weak points in ruins.  
	- Provides minor crafting services for excavation tools.

	Quest :  
- Quest Title : "Break It or Save It?"  
	- Quest Type : Side Quest  
	- Objective(s) : Players must assist Ronan in analyzing a partially collapsed ruin. They will be given two choices—  
		1. Carefully reinforce the structure to excavate safely (*Liora's preferred method*).  
		2. Use brute force to break through unstable debris (*Ronan’s preferred method*).  
	- Rewards :  
		- Choosing Liora’s method grants a Delicate Excavation Tool (+5% increased artifact drop chance).  
		- Choosing Ronan’s method grants a Heavy Digging Pick (+10% faster excavation speed but increases risk of damaging relics).  
	- Conditions : Must have at least a Basic Archaeology Skill to accept the quest.  
	- Quest Dialogue :  
		- Opening :  
			- “See that ruin over there? It’s half buried. Liora wants to take all day clearing it carefully, but I say we bust right through. What do you think?”  
		- Mid-Quest :  
			- (*If choosing careful excavation*) “Ugh, this is slow work... but I’ll admit, it’s safer.”  
			- (*If choosing brute force*) “Now that’s what I’m talking about! Step back and let’s crack this thing open!”  
		- Completion :  
			- (*If choosing Liora’s method*) “Alright, alright, I’ll admit… slow and steady worked this time.”  
			- (*If choosing Ronan’s method*) “That was satisfying, wasn’t it? Hope you found something good in there.”  
	- Additional Notes : The outcome slightly affects how both Ronan and Liora interact with the player in future quests.
