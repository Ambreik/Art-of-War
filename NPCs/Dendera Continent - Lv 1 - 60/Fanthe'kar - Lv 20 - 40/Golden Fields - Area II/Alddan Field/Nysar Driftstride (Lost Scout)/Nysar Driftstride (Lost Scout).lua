			Nysar Driftstride (Lost Scout)

	Location : "Alddan Field", roaming in a secluded or perilous area.  

---

	Appearance : "Nysar" is a lean, rugged man in his late 30s with a weathered face from days spent under the sun. His leather armor is patched but 
well-kept, and a green scout’s scarf is tied around his neck. He carries a short sword at his hip and a map pouch slung over his shoulder. Beside him 
stands his loyal donkey, laden with supplies—sacks, crates, and pockets in its harness stuffed with scrolls and parchments.  

---

	Personality : Nysar is cautious but approachable, always on edge from being lost in the field. He speaks in a direct, practical tone but softens 
when asked about his donkey, whom he refers to as "Olive". He is protective of his supplies and documents, wary of strangers until they prove 
trustworthy. However, his sense of duty drives him to ask for help when needed.
