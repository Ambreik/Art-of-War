			Lena Farrow  

	Location : Golden Fields – Northern Area  

---  

	Appearance : Lena is a young, energetic woman with shoulder-length auburn hair tied back into a loose ponytail, revealing a few stray strands that always seem 
to escape. Her amber eyes gleam with excitement whenever she discusses ancient civilizations. She wears a practical, lightweight explorer’s outfit—sturdy boots, a 
sleeveless tunic over a long-sleeved linen shirt, and reinforced leather gloves to protect her hands during excavations. A small satchel hangs at her hip, filled 
with parchment, charcoal sticks, and fragments of old texts she studies obsessively. A single, decorative feather is tucked behind her ear, a personal keepsake from
her first major dig.

	Personality : Lena is passionate, inquisitive, and sometimes a little too eager when it comes to uncovering secrets of the past. She thrives on discovery and is
constantly seeking the next big find. Though highly intelligent, she has a tendency to rush into things, often getting scolded by Edric for her impatience. She 
enjoys debating theories about ancient civilizations and their customs, especially with anyone who shows interest. Despite her impulsiveness, she deeply respects 
the artifacts she uncovers and gets frustrated when others handle history carelessly.
