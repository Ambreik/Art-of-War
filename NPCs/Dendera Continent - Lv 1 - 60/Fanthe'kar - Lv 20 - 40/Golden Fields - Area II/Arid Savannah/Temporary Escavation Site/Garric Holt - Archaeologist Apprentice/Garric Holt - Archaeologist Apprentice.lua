			Garric Holt  

	Location : Golden Fields – Northern Area  

---  

	Appearance : Garric is a broad-shouldered man in his early forties, with a weathered face, tanned from years of fieldwork under the sun. His short, graying 
beard gives him a rugged look, and his dark brown eyes carry a quiet intensity. Unlike the other apprentices, he wears a reinforced leather vest over his linen 
shirt, along with thick gloves and knee-high boots—evidence of his preference for heavy-duty excavation work. A sturdy belt holds various digging tools, and a large
pickaxe rests against his shoulder whenever he’s not using it. His movements are slow but deliberate, embodying a methodical and patient approach to his work.  

---  

	Personality : Garric is a no-nonsense pragmatist who believes in hard work over academic theory. He prefers hands-on excavation and has little patience for 
lengthy debates about historical interpretations. Despite his gruff exterior, he has deep respect for history and the effort it takes to unearth it properly. He 
often butts heads with Lena over her impulsiveness but secretly admires her passion. He is known for his dry humor and tendency to mutter skeptical remarks under 
his breath. Though not one for idle conversation, he’s fiercely protective of his team and will step in if he senses trouble.

- Occasionally grumbles about "scholars who think too much and dig too little."  
- Rolls his eyes whenever Lena starts theorizing too wildly but will still listen.  
- Keeps an eye on the surroundings, wary of potential threats or disturbances.

		- Mid-Quest : "Slow down, don’t just smash through everything. You’ll ruin something important that way."

	Quotes :  
- "[The past is buried for a reason. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t dig it up—just that we should do it right.]"  
- "[You don’t need a fancy degree to know how to use a pickaxe. Just patience and respect for what’s underneath.]"  
- "[I don’t trust ruins. Too many ways to get yourself killed. Then again, that’s probably why history is so interesting.]"
