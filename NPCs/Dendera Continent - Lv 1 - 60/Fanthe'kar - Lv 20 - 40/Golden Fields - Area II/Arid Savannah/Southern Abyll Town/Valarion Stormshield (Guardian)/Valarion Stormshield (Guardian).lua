	Appearance : "Valarion" is a tall, broad-shouldered warrior with a rugged, battle-worn appearance. His skin is sun-kissed from years of exposure

durable plate with the town's crest emblazoned across his chest, showing signs of wear but still formidable in appearance. His shield, large and 
round, is always strapped to his back, and he carries a large sword at his side, ready for combat.

unfriendly either—his loyalty to Southern Abyll Town is unwavering, and he respects those who show courage and dedication. He has a strong sense of 
duty and expects nothing less from those who work alongside him.
