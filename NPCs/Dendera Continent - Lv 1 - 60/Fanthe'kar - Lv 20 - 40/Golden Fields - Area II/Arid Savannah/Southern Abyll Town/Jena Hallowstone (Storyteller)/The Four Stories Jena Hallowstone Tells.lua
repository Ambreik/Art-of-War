		The Four Stories Jena Hallowstone Tells :

	1. The Tale of the Great Divide  
	Long ago, before the sands of Southern Abyll were as barren as they are now, the land was whole. The Great Divide was caused by a battle between 
two mighty beings—one a god of creation, the other a deity of destruction. Their clash tore the earth asunder, creating the vast chasms and rifts that
are now scattered throughout the region. These divides not only changed the landscape but also the flow of magic itself, disrupting the ancient 
balance. Legends say that those who venture too close to the Great Divide can still hear the voices of the gods, echoing from deep within.

	2. The Forgotten Empire of Rakh-Galo  
	The Rakh-Galor Empire was a civilization that spanned much of the desert before its mysterious disappearance. Known for their mastery over both 
arcane and elemental magic, the Rakh-Galor built monumental cities and towers, some of which still stand in ruins today. The empire fell when its 
rulers became consumed by greed and ambition, attempting to harness an ancient power that was too great for them to control. As they sought to tap 
into forbidden magic, the empire was engulfed by a massive storm of sand and flame. Only ruins remain, and many adventurers have sought to uncover the
secrets of the Rakh-Galor, but the dangers within the ruins are often too great for any to return.

	3. The Ghost of the Sands  
	There is an eerie tale of a ghostly figure that wanders the desert, searching for a lost artifact of immeasurable power. The ghost is said to be 
the last living descendant of a proud desert tribe that was wiped out by invaders centuries ago. The figure appears only during moonless nights, 
cloaked in shadows, with eyes that burn like embers. It is believed that the ghost’s spirit cannot rest until it has recovered the artifact, which 
holds the key to restoring its tribe's legacy. Some say the artifact is buried deep in the ruins, while others believe it lies in the heart of the 
desert, beyond the reach of any mortal.

	4. The Birth of Southern Abyll Town  
	Southern Abyll Town began as a humble settlement, founded around a mystical wellspring that the ancients believed was blessed by the gods. It was 
said that the well never ran dry, even during the harshest of droughts, and its waters could heal wounds and cure ailments. As word spread of the 
well’s power, the settlement grew into a bustling town, attracting explorers, traders, and adventurers. Over the years, it survived invasions, natural
disasters, and the occasional desert storm. It eventually became a hub for trade, especially for those seeking knowledge and relics from the 
surrounding ruins. However, the true location of the wellspring is a secret, and many believe it still holds untold power, hidden beneath the town's 
foundations.
