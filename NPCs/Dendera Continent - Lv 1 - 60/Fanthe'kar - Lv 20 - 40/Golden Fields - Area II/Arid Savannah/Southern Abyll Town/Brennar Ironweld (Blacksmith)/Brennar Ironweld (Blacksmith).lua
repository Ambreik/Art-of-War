	Appearance : "Brennar" is a burly, middle-aged dwarf with a well-maintained, thick beard and a pair of intelligent, piercing blue eyes. His arms 
are covered in muscle from years of hammering steel. He wears a leather apron over a soot-streaked tunic, and his hands are often covered in grime 
from his work at the forge. A sturdy hammer hangs from his belt, a tool he uses as both a weapon and an essential part of his craft.

	Personality : Brennar is serious and focused, rarely wasting words unless it’s about metal or his craft. He has an old-school work ethic and 
prides himself on the quality of his work. Though stern in demeanor, he holds a deep respect for adventurers and understands the importance of their 
gear. He speaks in a low, gravelly voice, often accompanied by the sound of clanging metal as he works at the forge.

	Quotes :  
- "A good weapon is only as strong as the hands that wield it. But don’t forget—it’s the forge that gives it its true edge."
- "You want an upgrade? Bring me the right materials, and I’ll make sure it’ll last you through hell and back."
- "I’ve worked metal all my life. If you need repairs, I’ll give you the finest, but don't expect me to work magic on a broken piece of junk."
