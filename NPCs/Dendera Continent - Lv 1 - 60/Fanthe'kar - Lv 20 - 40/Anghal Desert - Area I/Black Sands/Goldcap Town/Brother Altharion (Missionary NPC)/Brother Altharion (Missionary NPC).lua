			Brother Altharion (Missionary NPC)

	Appearance : "Brother Altharion" appears as an ordinary, middle-aged man, dressed in simple, worn clothing suited for travel. His hair is short and 
dark, with a few streaks of gray, and he carries a satchel with notes, maps, and various supplies. He has a calm, approachable demeanor, and while his 
appearance may suggest he is a figure of faith, he does not carry any religious symbols. His presence is neutral, and his actions are driven by a desire
to help the town and its people. Despite his humble appearance, there is a certain wisdom in his eyes, and a quiet sense of purpose in his movements.

	Personality : Altharion is a well-meaning, charismatic individual, though he prefers not to speak of his past. He is not driven by any religious or 
doctrinal beliefs but instead seeks to aid those in need through practical means. He believes in the power of community and often works behind the 
scenes, ensuring that individuals and groups are given the tools they need to succeed. He may seem enigmatic at times, but his dedication to the 
betterment of Goldcap Town and the faction is unquestionable.

	Role : Brother Altharion is a "Missionary NPC", though not in the traditional sense of a religious figure. He offers a range of quests and tasks to

NPCs in the town and help foster goodwill between them and the various factions within the region.  
	He plays a pivotal role in the "Favor System" by offering players tasks that increase favor with other important NPCs in the town, indirectly 
influencing the faction’s standing. However, Altharion himself does not receive or offer direct favor points. His primary function is to act as a 
facilitator and catalyst for favor between players and other NPCs.
