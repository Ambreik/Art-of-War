crest—a blazing flame over a sturdy stone wall. His belt holds a ceremonial sword, more symbolic than practical, though it appears well-maintained.  

	Personality : A firm but fair leader, Tormund is deeply protective of his people. He exudes confidence and calm, always willing to listen to 
concerns but decisive when action is needed. His speech is direct, though his tone softens when addressing children or elderly villagers. He values 
loyalty, hard work, and unity above all.
