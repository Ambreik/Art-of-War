			Telara Windstrider

	Location : "Goldcap Town" (near the central square or designated fast-travel hub within the town)

	Appearance : "Telara Windstrider" appears as a graceful and ethereal figure, her age hard to pinpoint—she seems both ancient and timeless. She 
wears flowing robes that shimmer with an almost translucent quality, like they’re woven from the very air itself. Her robes billow gently as though 
caught in an invisible wind, and her hair flows freely, constantly swept by the breeze. Her eyes glow with a faint, mystical light, reflecting her 
deep connection to the elemental forces. She carries a "windstaff" or "air crystal", a glowing artifact used to channel her teleportation magic.

	Personality : Telara is calm, serene, and thoughtful, embodying the stillness of the wind before a storm. She speaks in a soft but authoritative 
voice, offering guidance with a gentle air of wisdom. While she is helpful and approachable, there’s a hint of mystery about her, as though she knows 
much more than she reveals. She believes in the power of the winds and sees herself as a steward of the ancient teleportation pathways that allow safe
passage across the continent. She’s not one for small talk, but her rare smiles are earned by those who prove themselves worthy of her services.  

	Backstory and Lore : Telara Windstrider is a descendant of the "Windborne Clan", known for their mastery over the "Wind Paths", ancient 
teleportation rituals that allow travelers to bypass the impassable mountain ranges that separate the continents. After the "Second Great War", the 
Windborne Clan’s knowledge was rediscovered, and Telara took it upon herself to continue this legacy. She now uses her magical powers to help 
adventurers cross between the dangerous regions of "Dendera", "Fanthe'kar", and "Garland". Though she offers her services for a fee, her connection to
the wind is more than just a business—it is a sacred duty.

	Quotes :  
- "Ah, a wanderer seeking swift passage, are you? The winds of the world can guide your steps, but remember, not all travelers are allowed to cross the paths without cost. Do you wish to proceed?"
- "The winds are strong today. For a small fee, I will carry you swiftly to Fanthe'kar, where greater adventures await."  
- "At Level 40, your journey takes you beyond the mountains. The winds are now prepared to carry you to Garland. A steep price is required for this service, but few can traverse the mountains on their own."
