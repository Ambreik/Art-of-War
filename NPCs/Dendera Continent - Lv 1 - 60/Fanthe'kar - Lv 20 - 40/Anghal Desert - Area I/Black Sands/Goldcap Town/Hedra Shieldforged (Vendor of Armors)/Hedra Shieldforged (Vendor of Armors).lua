			Hedra Shieldforged (Vendor of Armors)

	Appearance : "Hedra Shieldforged" shares a strong family resemblance with her brother, Gareth, though her features are sharper, and her demeanor 
more intense. She has short, cropped auburn hair and a pair of striking green eyes that seem to size up everyone who approaches. She wears a sturdy 
leather jerkin reinforced with metal plates, hinting at her expertise in defensive gear. Her hands are calloused from years of fitting armor, and she 
often carries a small toolkit for minor adjustments. The armors displayed in her shop shine under the sun, showcasing her meticulous care for every 
piece.  

	Personality : Hedra is pragmatic and sharp-tongued, with a dry sense of humor. She takes pride in her armors, often remarking on their superior 
craftsmanship compared to what she calls "scrap sold in other towns." Though initially reserved, she is fiercely loyal to her family and the town, and 
she doesn’t tolerate rudeness or haggling. Her blunt honesty often leaves customers either amused or intimidated.
