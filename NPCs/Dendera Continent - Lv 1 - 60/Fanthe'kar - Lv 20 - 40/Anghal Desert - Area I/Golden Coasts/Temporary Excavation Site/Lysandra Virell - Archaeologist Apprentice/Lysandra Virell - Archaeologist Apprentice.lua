			Lysandra Virell

	Location : Ngahl Desert - Golden Coasts - Temporary Excavation Site

---

	Appearance : Lysandra Virell is a tall and lean woman in her mid-twenties, with striking silver-gray eyes that stand out against her tan, weathered skin. Her 
long, black hair is braided tightly behind her head to keep it out of the way as she works, though strands often escape during her work. Lysandra dresses in 
practical, lightweight desert clothing, including a loose tunic and a scarf that covers her neck, offering some protection from the heat. Her boots are well-worn, 
evidence of many long hours spent traversing the site. She carries a wooden crate of delicate tools, a notebook, and a magnifying glass at her side for inspecting 
finds, and her expression is often serious, focused on the task at hand.

	Personality :  
Lysandra is calm, collected, and very methodical in her approach to work. While she may appear distant at first, those who speak with her soon realize she has a dry wit and a quiet confidence. She is meticulous and takes great pride in her role at the excavation site, often preferring to do things herself rather than ask for help. Her passion for discovering ancient artifacts is evident, and she speaks with great reverence about the history hidden beneath the desert sands. She can be a bit stubborn, especially when it comes to doing things “the right way,” but her determination and professionalism make her a valuable asset to the team.

	Behaviour : Lysandra can usually be found examining recently unearthed artifacts or carefully cataloging her findings in the small tent she shares with other 
apprentices. She moves with precision, occasionally stopping to give instructions to Tarek or other workers on the site. She rarely seeks out players directly, 
preferring instead to remain focused on her work, but if approached, she’ll give brief and pointed replies. Lysandra is also known to send players on more specific 
and challenging quests related to artifact recovery, which often require careful observation and attention to detail.
