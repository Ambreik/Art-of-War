			Professor Zaynara Tashir

	Location : Angahl Desert - Golden Coasts - Temporary Excavation Site

---

	Appearance : Professor Zaynara Tashir is a middle-aged woman with long, silvering black hair tied back into a tight braid. Her face is weathered from years of 
exposure to the harsh desert sun, with sharp features and intelligent, piercing green eyes. She wears a practical yet distinguished outfit: a beige explorer’s coat,
sturdy brown leather gloves, and a wide-brimmed hat to protect her from the sun. A belt laden with excavation tools, maps, and scroll cases completes her look. Her 
posture is straight, giving off an air of authority and expertise. A pair of gold-rimmed spectacles rest atop her nose, often sliding down when she’s deeply 
immersed in her work.

---

	Personality : Professor Tashir is a brilliant and focused individual, deeply passionate about archaeology and history. She has a calm, measured demeanor, often 
speaking in a composed, thoughtful manner. While she may come across as distant at first, those who earn her respect will find her to be a supportive and 
encouraging mentor. She can be blunt at times, particularly when it comes to her research, and is impatient with distractions, but she takes pride in passing down 
her knowledge. Her fascination with ancient cultures makes her eager to share discoveries, even if it means long hours spent poring over fragments of ancient 
scrolls.

---

	Behaviour : Professor Tashir is often seen inspecting ancient relics or speaking with the apprentices. She rarely takes breaks, and when she does, she enjoys 
watching the excavation progress from a distance. Occasionally, she may engage in deep conversations with players about the history of the desert or the 
significance of a newly discovered artifact. If players bring new findings, she will offer a brief, thoughtful evaluation.
