			Tarek Solis

	Location : Ngahl Desert - Golden Coasts - Temporary Excavation Site

---

	Appearance : Tarek Solis is a young man in his early twenties, with messy dark brown hair and a sun-kissed complexion from working long hours under the desert 
sun. His clothing is a mix of practicality and rough-hewn adventure: a simple, worn tunic, trousers, and sturdy boots made for the harsh terrain. A leather satchel 
filled with excavation tools and notebooks hangs at his side. His bright blue eyes are constantly scanning the area, full of excitement and curiosity, while his 
posture is that of someone eager to prove themselves, standing a bit too upright for comfort. A faint dusting of sand often clings to his clothes, but he always 
wears a wide grin, enthusiastic about every small discovery.

---

	Personality : Tarek is friendly, energetic, and optimistic, constantly bubbling with enthusiasm about the work he’s doing. He tends to speak quickly, with a 
youthful eagerness, and often has a tendency to ramble when talking about the excavation site or any new discoveries he makes. His inexperience shows at times, but 
he makes up for it with a willingness to learn and help wherever he can. He is very approachable, always willing to offer guidance to others, even if it means 
making a few mistakes along the way. Tarek’s sincerity is infectious, and players will find it easy to get along with him, even if his tasks may seem basic.

---

	Behaviour : Tarek is often seen at the edges of the excavation site, digging through sand or carefully cataloging artifacts under the guidance of the professor.
He’ll sometimes approach players with a wide grin, eager to share what he’s learned or ask for assistance with a simple task. He’s constantly on the move, 
occasionally pausing to inspect new findings and jot down notes in his journal. Despite his enthusiasm, Tarek can be forgetful or disorganized, and might ask 
players to repeat tasks for him.

	Role :  
- Role(s) : Apprentice, Quest Giver  
	Tarek serves as an apprentice who helps with the more mundane but necessary tasks at the excavation site. He offers simple quests for players, such as gathering
tools, locating specific artifacts, or assisting in the cleanup of discovered sites. He also provides a starting point for players interested in contributing to the
excavation efforts and advancing their own skills in archaeology.
