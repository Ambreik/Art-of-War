			Borin Ironfoot  

	Role : Guardian – Soldier Dedicated to Guarding the Camp  
	Location : Fierdon Expedition Camp – Perimeter Watch Post  

---

	Appearance : Borin Ironfoot is a broad-shouldered, battle-hardened dwarf with a thick, dark brown beard streaked with silver. His face is weathered, with deep 
lines that tell the story of a life spent in conflict. His piercing gray eyes scan the camp constantly, always alert for signs of trouble. He wears reinforced 
chainmail under a thick, dark green cloak, fastened with a silver clasp bearing the insignia of his former regiment. His armor is well-worn but meticulously 
maintained, and his heavy iron boots—where he earned his name—clank solidly with every step.  
	A large round shield with a dented but sturdy surface rests on his back, and he carries a war axe at his side, its handle wrapped in worn leather. 
	Though he appears gruff and unapproachable at first glance, those who earn his respect will find a fiercely loyal ally.

	Personality : Borin is a disciplined, no-nonsense warrior who believes in order and duty above all else. He doesn’t tolerate laziness or recklessness, 
especially from adventurers who think the camp is just a place to rest and trade. However, despite his gruff demeanor, he has a strong sense of camaraderie with 
those who prove themselves capable.  
	He has little patience for merchants like "Corwin Diggold", whom he considers too focused on profit, but he understands the necessity of trade. He gets along 
best with researchers and fellow warriors, particularly those who respect the dangers of the excavation site. If asked about his past, he simply states, 
“I’ve fought in enough battles to know that no one wins forever.”

- He often stands near a campfire at night, methodically cleaning his armor and muttering about how "adventurers never watch their own backs."  
- If spoken to, he usually responds curtly unless the player has earned his trust.
