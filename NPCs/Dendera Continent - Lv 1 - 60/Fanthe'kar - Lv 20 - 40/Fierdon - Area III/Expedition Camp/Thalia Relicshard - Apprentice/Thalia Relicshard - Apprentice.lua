			Thalia Relicshard  

	Location : Fierdon Expedition Camp  

---

	Appearance : Thalia is a young woman in her mid-twenties with a sharp, analytical gaze and an air of quiet confidence. She has short, dark brown hair tied back 
in a practical braid, and her hazel eyes seem to always be scanning her surroundings with keen observation. Unlike Eldon, who often appears dusty from enthusiastic 
digging, Thalia maintains a neat and professional look. She wears a fitted leather vest over a deep blue tunic, sturdy gloves for handling delicate artifacts, and 
knee-high boots suited for both excavation and travel. A leather-bound tome filled with notes and sketches hangs from her belt, along with a small pouch containing 
brushes and other restoration tools.  

---

	Personality : Thalia is calm, meticulous, and highly intellectual. She values precision over speed and often rolls her eyes at Eldon's reckless enthusiasm. 
While she is not unfriendly, she can be somewhat reserved and prefers discussing archaeology over small talk. She respects those who take their time to study and 
understand history rather than rushing through excavation sites for quick discoveries. However, beneath her serious demeanor, she has a dry sense of humor and 
occasionally teases Eldon when he makes mistakes.  
	Thalia takes great pride in her work and aspires to one day lead her own excavation project. She is highly knowledgeable about ancient civilizations and enjoys 
sharing insights with players who show a genuine interest in archaeology.  

---

	Behaviour : Thalia spends most of her time at the Artifact Analysis Tent**, carefully cleaning and studying relics that have been unearthed by the excavation 
team. Unlike Eldon, who is often found running around the dig site, Thalia is usually seated at a wooden table with brushes, scrolls, and vials of preservation 
fluid. If approached, she may be found sketching a diagram of a newly uncovered artifact or cross-referencing findings with historical texts.  
	Thalia is not easily distracted, but if a player presents her with an unusual artifact, she will immediately shift her focus and provide an insightful analysis.
