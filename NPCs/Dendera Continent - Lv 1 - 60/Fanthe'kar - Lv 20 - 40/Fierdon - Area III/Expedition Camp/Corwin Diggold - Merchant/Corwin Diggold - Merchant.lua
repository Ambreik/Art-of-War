			Corwin Diggold  

	Location : Fierdon Expedition Camp – Merchant's Supply Tent  

---

	Appearance : Corwin Diggold is a stocky, middle-aged man with a neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard and piercing blue eyes that constantly scan his 
surroundings for potential business opportunities. His sun-kissed skin and slightly worn but well-maintained attire suggest years of experience traveling between 
excavation sites. He wears a finely tailored, earth-toned coat over a sturdy linen shirt, with multiple pockets sewn into his vest for easy access to coins, notes, 
and trinkets. A thick leather belt holds an assortment of pouches, some jingling with coin, others filled with rare finds waiting to be appraised.  
	Standing beside him at all times is Atlas, his massive, shaggy guardian dog—a rare breed known for its size and protective instincts. With its thick, white-and-
ash fur, deep-set amber eyes, and an intimidating stance, Atlas ensures that no one tries to walk off with Corwin’s wares without paying.

	Personality : Corwin is a shrewd yet charismatic merchant who thrives on the excitement of discovery. He enjoys bargaining and has a keen sense for valuable 
artifacts, always looking for ways to turn a profit. While he maintains a friendly and approachable demeanor, he is quick to spot a scam and isn’t afraid to call 
out a dishonest customer.  
	He has a deep appreciation for history, though mostly from a business perspective—after all, "old things sell for new gold." Despite his mercantile nature, he 
has a strong sense of loyalty to the archaeologists he works with and provides fair deals for those who bring him rare and legitimate finds.  
	Corwin treats Atlas as both a loyal companion and a business partner, often speaking to the massive dog as if it were his equal. He firmly believes that no one 
dares haggle too aggressively with a merchant who has a bear-sized guardian at his side.  

---

	Behaviour : Corwin spends most of his time at his supply tent, arranging and displaying his wares, inspecting newly acquired artifacts, and engaging in 
negotiations with adventurers and scholars alike. Players will often find him polishing relics, organizing trade ledgers, or absentmindedly tossing a dried meat 
treat to Atlas, who never strays far from his master’s side.  
	If a player attempts to steal from Corwin, Atlas will issue a low warning growl, and if they persist, the dog will physically block their path until Corwin 
handles the situation.
