			Grizzle  

	Location : Fierdon Expedition Camp  

---

	Appearance : Grizzle is an enormous, thick-furred dog with a rugged coat of deep brown and gray, built like a warhound yet retaining the fluffiness of a 
mountain dog. His amber eyes burn with intelligence, constantly scanning the area for threats. His reinforced leather harness bears an engraved metal tag reading, 
"Protector of Corwin Diggold." Scars across his legs hint at past battles, and his massive paws leave deep imprints in the dirt wherever he walks.  

---

	Personality : Loyal to the bone, Grizzle is highly protective of "Corwin Diggold", the camp’s merchant, and will not hesitate to attack anything that threatens 
him. Despite his fierce nature, he can be affectionate towards friendly players, accepting food and occasional pats. However, if provoked, he quickly shifts into an
aggressive stance, warning players or creatures before lunging into combat.

	Behavior & Mechanics :   

- Adjustable Combat Stats :  
	- Grizzle does not have a fixed level; instead, his stats scale based on the level and combat power of the opponent.  
	- If facing a single player, his strength matches theirs. If fighting a party, his strength increases accordingly.  

- Combat Capabilities :  
	- Can Attack & Be Attacked : Grizzle will defend "Corwin Diggold" against threats, engaging enemies that attack or approach aggressively.  
	- Creature Aggression : If hostile creatures wander too close to the camp, Grizzle may chase them off or outright attack.  
	- Resilient in PvP :  
		- Cannot be killed by a solo player.  
		- Requires a coordinated party attack to bring him down.  
		- If defeated, he enters a "downed state" for 5 minutes before reviving.  
		- After revival, he becomes temporarily "cautious" and won’t attack unless provoked again.  

- Patrolling Behavior :  
	- Grizzle moves around the camp in a set patrol route, stopping occasionally to sniff, stretch, or watch the horizon.  
	- If "Corwin Diggold" moves to a different spot, Grizzle follows within a small radius.  

- Merchant Protection Mechanics :  
	- If Corwin Diggold is attacked, Grizzle immediately engages the aggressor.  
	- If the attacker is a player, Grizzle growls first, warning them to stop.  
	- If the attack continues, he lunges and fights until either he or the attacker is downed.  
	- If Corwin is slain, Grizzle enters a "Rage State", increasing his attack speed and damage for 30 seconds before retreating to the camp's center.

		Player Interactions with Grizzle :   

	Players can interact with Grizzle in multiple ways, using various mechanics:  

- /Pet – Grizzle wags his tail and lets out a deep, approving huff.  
- /Sit near him – He lays down beside the player after a few seconds, watching them cautiously.  
- Feed (meat items only) – Players can give Grizzle raw or cooked meat. Depending on the quality:  
	- Common Meat: He eats it and goes back to patrolling.  
	- Rare/Quality Meat: He follows the player for 30 seconds before returning to Corwin.  
	- Legendary/Treated Meat: Grants the player a "Grizzle's Favor" buff, increasing defense slightly for 10 minutes.  
- Play Fetch – If a player has a stick or bone item, they can throw it. Grizzle runs after it and brings it back, wagging his tail.  
- Command Interaction (Faction-Specific) 
	- If the player is Neutral or Friendly, they can issue simple commands: "Stay," "Follow for 1 min," or "Guard Corwin."  
	- If the player has attacked Corwin before, Grizzle will growl and refuse any interaction.
	- If is a visible "Outlaw" player, he will be cautious with any interactions.
