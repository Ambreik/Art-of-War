			Lira Stonescribe

	Location : Fierdon Expedition Camp

	Appearance : Lira Stonescribe is a woman in her mid-thirties, with sharp, intelligent eyes and a weathered face that speaks to years of fieldwork. Her long dark
brown hair is often tied back in a loose ponytail, and her skin bears the tan of someone who spends long hours outdoors. She wears a practical, rugged outfit suited
for excavation work: a faded leather vest over a long-sleeved tunic, sturdy pants, and well-worn boots. Her belt is adorned with various tools—chisels, brushes, and
a magnifying glass for detailed inspection of artifacts. A small satchel with parchment, ink, and notes hangs from her side. A map of ancient sites is always within
arm’s reach.

	Personality : Lira is meticulous, focused, and deeply passionate about uncovering the past. She speaks with a quiet, thoughtful tone, preferring to listen first
before offering her insight. Although reserved at times, she is always eager to share her knowledge of ancient cultures and artifacts. Lira values patience and 
persistence, often advising others to look beyond the surface when it comes to their research. She's calm under pressure and encourages young apprentices to take 
their time when making discoveries, but can be easily frustrated when others rush or dismiss the importance of small findings.

	Behaviour : Lira remains dedicated to her work, spending most of her time at the excavation site or cataloging newly discovered items. She rarely leaves the 
camp, preferring to stay close to the artifacts and knowledge that fuel her passion. If players approach with questions or requests, she will engage in conversation
with careful precision, often offering thoughtful responses that relate to archaeology or the history of the region. She also provides assistance with small, field-
based tasks such as gathering materials or solving puzzles in the excavation process.
