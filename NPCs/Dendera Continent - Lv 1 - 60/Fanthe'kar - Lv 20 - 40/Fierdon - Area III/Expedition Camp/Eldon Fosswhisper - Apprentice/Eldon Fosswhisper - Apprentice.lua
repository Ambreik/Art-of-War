			Eldon Fosswhisper

	Location : Fierdon Expedition Camp

	Appearance :  
Eldon is a young man in his early twenties, with an air of curiosity and enthusiasm. His short, tousled blond hair is often covered by a wide-brimmed, dirt-streaked hat that provides some shade during long excavation sessions. His blue eyes are constantly scanning the ground for interesting finds, and his freckled face is often streaked with dirt from his latest dig. Eldon wears a loose, light green tunic, brown leather gloves, and sturdy boots—all worn from many hours in the field. A small satchel filled with excavation tools hangs from his side, and a magnifying glass dangles from a chain around his neck. He carries a small notebook where he records his findings and thoughts.

	Personality : Eldon is bright-eyed and eager to prove himself, but he sometimes lacks the patience that true archaeology requires. He's quick to jump into 
action, often getting excited about any new discovery, no matter how small. Eldon is talkative and friendly, and he enjoys engaging with players about the latest 
discoveries, though he can sometimes be a bit overly enthusiastic and rush into things. Despite his occasional lack of caution, Eldon is driven by a deep 
fascination with the past and a genuine desire to contribute to the field. He's always willing to lend a hand, though his assistance can sometimes be a bit hasty.

	Behaviour : Eldon spends most of his time assisting Lira Stonescribe with cataloging and excavating artifacts. He’s often seen working alongside other 
apprentices, but he tends to get sidetracked by new finds or unusual details in the terrain. His enthusiasm often leads him to strike up conversations with players,
asking them about their travels and experiences in the field. When given tasks, Eldon approaches them with determination, although he occasionally needs to be 
reminded to slow down and focus on the finer details. He is always looking for ways to impress his mentor, Lira, and will often take on small quests to learn more 
about archaeology.
