	Appearance : "Marenna" is a middle-aged human woman with a poised demeanor. She wears an elegant dress stitched from intricate fabrics, showcasing
her skill. Her hair is pulled back into a braided bun adorned with sewing needles. Around her waist is a belt holding spools of thread and small 
scissors, and a measuring tape drapes over her shoulders like a sash. Her workshop is decorated with bolts of colorful cloth and mannequins displaying
her finest creations.

	Personality : Warm and meticulous, Marenna takes pride in her craft and is eager to guide others in the art of tailoring. She has a sharp eye for 
detail and an encouraging nature, but she has little patience for those who waste her time. She often hums while she works and speaks with a gentle, 
instructive tone.
