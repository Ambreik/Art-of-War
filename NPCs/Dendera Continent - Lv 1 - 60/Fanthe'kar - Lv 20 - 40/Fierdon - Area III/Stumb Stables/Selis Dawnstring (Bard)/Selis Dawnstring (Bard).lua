		Stories :  

1. "The Ballad of the Sunlit Warrior"  
	Selis recounts the tale of a lone warrior who, armed only with a sword forged by the rays of the sun, defended a village against an army of shadow
creatures. The warrior’s courage became legend, and the sword, glowing with the eternal light, was said to be buried in a hidden grove, awaiting a new
hero to wield it.  

2. "The Whispering Grove"  
	This story speaks of a magical forest where trees communicate through whispers carried by the wind. According to Selis, travelers who pause to 
listen may hear secrets of the past or guidance for their journey. But those who enter with ill intent are never seen again.  

3. "The Starbound Lovers"  
	A heartwarming yet tragic tale of two lovers separated by warring kingdoms who wished upon the same star every night. The star, moved by their 
devotion, descended to Earth and united them. Their love, unbreakable even by death, is said to have formed the constellation "Eternal Embrace," 
visible on clear nights.
