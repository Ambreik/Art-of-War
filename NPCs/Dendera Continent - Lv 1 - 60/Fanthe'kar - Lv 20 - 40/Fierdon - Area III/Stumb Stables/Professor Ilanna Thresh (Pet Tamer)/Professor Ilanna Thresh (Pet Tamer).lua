	Appearance : A slender woman in her early 40s with a curious gleam in her hazel eyes. She wears a practical, earth-toned outfit accented with 
pockets and belts, each filled with tools like vials, journals, and small brushes. Her hands are often stained with ink or dirt from her research. A 
pair of wire-rimmed glasses rests on her nose, and her graying brown hair is tied back in a loose bun.

prone to misplaced notes and forgotten tools, which may lead to quests.
