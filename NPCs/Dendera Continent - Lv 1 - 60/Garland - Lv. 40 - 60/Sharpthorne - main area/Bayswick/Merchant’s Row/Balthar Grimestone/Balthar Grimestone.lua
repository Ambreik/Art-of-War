	Appearance : Balthar Grimestone is a middle-aged man with a burly build, standing just under six feet tall. His thick, dark beard is streaked with gray, and his
sharp, steel-blue eyes are framed by a perpetual furrow in his brow. He wears a well-maintained merchant's apron over sturdy work clothes, and a leather pouch 
hangs at his side. His hands are calloused, a testament to years of hard labor, and he often carries a ledger tucked under his arm.

can come across as curt, he softens when discussing the well-being of the community. He is known to be fiercely loyal to those who earn his trust and has a dry 
sense of humor that surfaces unexpectedly.
