	Appearance : Grimbor is a tall, muscular figure with a thick beard, his skin weathered and tanned from years spent working near the forge. His broad shoulders 
are often hunched slightly from the weight of his work, and his strong arms are covered in faint burn scars and callouses. He wears a heavy leather apron over a 
simple shirt and pants, with a hammer at his side. His boots are reinforced with steel, and his hands are never without a few tools, whether it's a pair of tongs, 
a small hammer, or a mallet. His eyes glow with the fire of a craftsman who has spent a lifetime in the heat of the forge.

in his work that shows when he discusses the items he crafts. He’s serious about his craft, and his focus is unmatched when he's working on the forge. Grimbor has 
little patience for distractions, but those who respect the art of blacksmithing will find a valuable ally in him. He’s not overly talkative, but there’s a warmth 
to him when he talks shop, and he’s always willing to offer advice to those wanting to improve their craft.
