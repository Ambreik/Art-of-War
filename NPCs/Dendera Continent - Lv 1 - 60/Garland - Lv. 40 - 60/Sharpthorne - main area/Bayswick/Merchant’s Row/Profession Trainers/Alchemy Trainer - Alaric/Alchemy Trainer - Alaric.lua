			Alaric - Alchemy Trainer

	Location : "Merchant's Row", Commercial District

---

	Appearance : Alaric is an older man with a thin frame, draped in a long, faded robe covered in various stains from his alchemical experiments. His graying beard
and wild, unkempt hair give him a slightly eccentric look. He often carries a satchel full of vials, flasks, and other alchemical tools. His eyes are sharp, always 
studying the world around him for new mixtures, with a faint, almost constant smile on his face.

---

	Personality : Alaric is a curious, methodical person with a passion for experimenting. He enjoys discussing the finer points of alchemy with anyone willing to 
listen. Though often distracted by his thoughts on his next great discovery, he’s warm and friendly to those who share his love of mixing potions and creating 
elixirs. His speech is peppered with excitement about the possibilities of alchemy, though he can also be quite absent-minded at times.
