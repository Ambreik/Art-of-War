---

	Location : "Merchant's Row", Commercial District 

---

	Appearance : Larkel is a rugged, tall elf with a lean, muscular build, suited to the harshness of the wild. His skin is weathered from years spent in the 
wilderness, and his piercing green eyes reflect the sharpness of his senses. His attire is a mix of camouflage materials—leather armor and furs—blended perfectly 
with the environment. A quiver of arrows is slung across his back, and his trusty bow is always within reach. A pair of hunting knives are attached to his waist, 
and his posture is always poised for action.

	Personality : Larkel is calm and methodical in his speech, often observing the world around him before reacting. He speaks with the wisdom of someone who has 
spent years tracking game through dense forests and unforgiving terrain. He values patience, precision, and strategy, preferring to study his prey carefully before 
making a move. He’s not overly friendly but shows respect to those who prove their worth through skill and determination. His stern demeanor often masks a dry sense
of humor.
