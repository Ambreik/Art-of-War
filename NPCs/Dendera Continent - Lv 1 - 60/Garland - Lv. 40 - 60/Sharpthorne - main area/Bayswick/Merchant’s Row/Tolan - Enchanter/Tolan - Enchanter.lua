			Tolan - Enchanter

	Location : "Merchant’s Row", Capital City

---

	Appearance : Tolan is a tall and imposing figure in his mid-forties, his long, dark hair falling loosely beneath a yellowish robe that resembles an elegant 
coat with intricate light blue designs along the hems and collar. The robe billows dramatically as he moves, and his feet are adorned with wooden sandals that creak
softly with each step. His sharp, calculating eyes are always watching his surroundings, reflecting his intellect and confidence. Despite his scholarly appearance,
his aura radiates immense power, and his movements are fluid and precise. His imposing presence commands respect, and his posture suggests a practiced ease in both 
magical and physical combat.

---

	Personality : Tolan is a serious and focused individual, with a quiet confidence in his abilities. He speaks with measured authority, never one to boast 
unnecessarily but always subtly aware of his exceptional talents. He has a natural curiosity about the world and enjoys teaching others about the intricacies of 
magic, though he never lets his guard down easily. When in a combat stance, he becomes prideful, admiring his skill and those of others around him. He values 
loyalty and seeks to create lasting connections with those who share his passion for magic, but he is fiercely protective of his shop and the other vendors in 
Merchant’s Row.

	Role :  
- Roles : Quest Giver, Vendor, Guardian  
	Tolan sells enchanted items and offers powerful magical runes that provide a variety of buffs to players. He is a skilled enchanter and can provide custom 
enchantments based on his high level of expertise. As a guardian, he also patrols the Merchant’s Row district and protects NPCs and shops from any threat, keeping 
watch for potential thieves or troublemakers. Additionally, Tolan offers quests to find rare magical components or to protect his shop.

	Mechanics :  
- Type : Quest Giver, Vendor, Guardian  
- Reputation : Completing Tolan’s quests improves reputation (REP) with factions tied to "Bayswick City".  
- Interaction Limitations : Available to all players, but the more powerful runes and enchantments require higher ranks or reputation to purchase.  
- PvP : Tolan is not flagged for PvP unless the player attacks him directly or engages in an event that turns him hostile. When engaged in combat, he becomes 
extremely difficult to defeat, requiring a strong party of players.  
- Respawn Time : N/A (as he is a high-ranked NPC, respawning is not applicable unless killed by players, in which case he respawns after 15 minutes).  
- Other Mechanics :  
	- Rune Rotation : Tolan’s stock of magical runes rotates regularly, offering different buffs and enhancements depending on the day and the phase of the season.
The rotation is dynamic and changes once every 48 hours, ensuring that players never know exactly what new runes or enchantments will be available. He may also sell
rare components required to craft even more powerful runes, adding depth to his trade.  
	- Combat Stance : While in combat stance, Tolan becomes a formidable foe. His combat skills include magical counterattacks and physical blocking. He can parry 
melee hits with his staff, absorb damage with magical barriers, and retaliate with powerful arcane bursts. Tolan also has the ability to heal himself periodically, 
using a restorative incantation to regain health. His movement speed during combat is enhanced, allowing him to dodge incoming attacks with ease. He is skilled at 
controlling the battlefield, using both magic and physical defense to create a nearly impenetrable defense.  
	- Guardian Role : Tolan patrols Merchant’s Row, acting as a guardian for the NPCs and shops in the area. He will intervene in any hostile situation, protecting
merchants and vendors from attackers or thieves. His intervention is swift and precise, and he can summon magical shields to block incoming projectiles.  
	- Outlaw Detection : Tolan has a unique ability to sense those who are outlaws in the vicinity. If an outlaw enters the Merchant's Row district or engages in 
hostile behavior, Tolan will automatically target them and attack on sight. His protective instincts are heightened, and he will not hesitate to deal with outlaws 
harshly, calling upon his powerful magical abilities to subdue them.

	Combat Mechanics  :  
- "Combat Stance Activation" : Tolan enters combat stance when he detects hostile players or NPCs within Merchant’s Row. He activates a set of magical barriers that
absorb incoming damage for a short time.  
- "Blocking and Parrying" : Using his staff and innate magical abilities, Tolan can block and parry most standard physical attacks, reflecting a portion of the 
damage back at his attackers.  
- "Healing Ability" : Once every 30 seconds, Tolan uses a healing spell to restore a portion of his health, making him particularly challenging to defeat unless 
players can coordinate their attacks effectively.  
- "Movement and Speed" : While in combat stance, Tolan’s movement speed is enhanced by his magical aura, allowing him to dodge incoming attacks. He can perform 
short bursts of speed to close the distance between him and his attackers or to evade dangerous spells.  
- "Magical Counterattack" : Tolan’s offensive abilities include high-damage magical bursts that he can unleash when he blocks or parries an attack. These bursts 
deal significant magical damage to anyone within his range, with an area-of-effect radius that expands based on his combat stance.  
- "Arcane Shield" : Tolan can summon an arcane shield around himself or nearby NPCs, mitigating incoming damage for a short duration. This shield absorbs a 
percentage of physical and magical attacks and can only be bypassed by heavy bursts of damage or specialized magical abilities.  
- "Ultimate Ability - Rune Surge" : Once per combat, Tolan can unleash a "Rune Surge," amplifying the power of his enchantments for a brief period During this time,
his attacks become faster, stronger, and harder to avoid, and he gains a temporary invulnerability to crowd-control effects (stuns, freezes, etc.).  
- "Retreat Mechanism" : If Tolan’s health falls below 25%, he will initiate a retreat phase, using teleportation magic to retreat to a safe location in Merchant’s
Row, where he can recover and re-engage after a brief cooldown period.
