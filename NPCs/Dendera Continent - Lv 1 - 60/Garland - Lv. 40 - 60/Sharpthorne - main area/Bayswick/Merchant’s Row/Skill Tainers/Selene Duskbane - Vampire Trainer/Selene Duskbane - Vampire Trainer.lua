			Selene Duskbane  

	Location : "Merchant's Row", Commercial District, inside the "Hall of Martial Valor"  

---  

	Appearance : Selene is a pale, statuesque woman with a commanding presence. She wears a high-collared black and crimson gown adorned with intricate silver 
jewelry shaped like bats and roses. Her long, dark hair cascades down her back, framing her glowing red eyes and sharp, elongated canines that hint at her vampiric 
heritage. A sleek, curved rapier with an ornate hilt rests at her side, her fingers often brushing its handle as if prepared for battle. Her movements are 
unnervingly graceful, almost like a dance, and she exudes an air of cold arrogance.

	Personality : Selene is confident, calculating, and unapologetically proud of her vampiric lineage. She speaks with an air of superiority but treats those who 
prove their worth with a measure of respect. Her sharp wit and biting sarcasm often intimidate those who approach her, though she shows patience with her 
studentsâ€”provided they exhibit the potential she demands.
