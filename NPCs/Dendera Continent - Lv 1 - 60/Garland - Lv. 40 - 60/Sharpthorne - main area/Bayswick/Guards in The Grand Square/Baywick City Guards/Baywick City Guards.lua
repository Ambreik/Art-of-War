	Appearance : Baywick City Guards are clad in polished steel armor with the emblem of Baywick emblazoned on their chest plates. They wear reinforced leather 
gloves and carry sturdy kite shields bearing the city's crest. Their helmets obscure most of their faces, leaving only their eyes visible beneath the metal visors.

nearly identical, emphasizing their professional and uniformed presence.

immediate hostility.
