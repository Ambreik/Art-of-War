	Appearance : "Old Finn" is a weathered, salt-and-pepper-bearded man in his late 60s. He has a wiry frame, hardened by years of fishing. His skin is tanned from 
exposure to the sun, with a few deep wrinkles along his forehead and around his eyes. He wears a weathered leather vest over a simple linen shirt, with a fishing 
hat perched on his head. His hands, though calloused, move with surprising deftness as he ties knots or cleans fish. A small wooden cane leans beside him, though he
doesn’t use it often. His eyes gleam with a youthful spark, despite his age.

	Personality : "Old Finn" has a gruff yet warm demeanor. He’s seen it all in his years as a fisherman,so he often speaks in a mix of wisdom and old sailor humor.
Though he may appear stern at first, he has a soft spot for eager adventurers looking to learn the ways of the sea. His interactions are often laced with short, 
cryptic advice, making him a bit of a mystery. He’s patient with those willing to listen, but quick to dismiss those who waste his time. He values respect for the 
sea and its creatures, and this is evident in his conversations.
