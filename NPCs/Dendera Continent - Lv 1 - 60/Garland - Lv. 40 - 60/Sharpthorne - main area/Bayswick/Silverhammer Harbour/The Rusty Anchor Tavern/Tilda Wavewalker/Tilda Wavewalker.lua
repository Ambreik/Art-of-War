		Story :
	Story 1: The Sea Serpent of Brinefall Cove  
_"Ah, ye want a tale, do ye? Well, gather 'round. There’s a spot just beyond Brinefall Cove. They call it 'The Maw,' ‘cause the rocks form a mouth, sharp as a wolf's teeth. I once sailed too close, thinkin' I could outrun a storm. Big mistake. A shadow rose from the depths, as long as the sky and as dark as midnight. A sea serpent, with scales like black ice. The storm had no power against it, and neither did our ship. We barely made it out, but I swear I heard its hissin’ voice in the wind sayin' 'I’ll see ye again, sailor.' Now I steer clear of The Maw and keep my distance from the waves after nightfall."_

	Story 2: The Curse of the Lost Pirate’s Gold  
_"Ah, ye’ve heard the stories of treasure, haven’t ye? But not all treasure’s worth the hunt. I was part of a crew once, huntin’ a pirate’s hoard hidden deep in the forest, right where the trees turn twisted and the fog never lifts. We found the chest, buried under a massive oak. But the moment we touched it, the air turned cold, and voices began whisperin' from nowhere. Said we'd be cursed ‘til the end of time. Old Captain Farrow laughed, but he wasn’t laughin’ when the first mate disappeared into the night, swallowed by the shadows. We left that gold behind, never to return. Some things are meant to stay buried."_

	Story 3: The Ghost Ship of Nighthollow Bay  
_"Aye, I’ve seen it. Many a sailor claims it’s just the mist playin’ tricks, but I know better. The Ghost Ship of Nighthollow Bay. Tall masts, tattered sails, and sails as pale as moonlight. She appears on nights when the fog rolls in thick, and she’s always just out of reach. Her crew—no faces, just hollow eyes, drifting in silence. They say the ship’s cursed, bound to sail the seas until they find the one who sank them. Last time I saw her, I could’ve sworn she was lookin’ right at me, just before she vanished back into the mist. No one’s seen her again, but every sailor I know has that one ship they’re always keepin’ an eye out for... that’s mine."_
