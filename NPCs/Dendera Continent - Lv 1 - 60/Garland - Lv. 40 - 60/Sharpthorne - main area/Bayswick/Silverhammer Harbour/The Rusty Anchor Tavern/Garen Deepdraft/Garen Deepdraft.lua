	Head to Bayswick City, find the local flower dealer, and purchase the special flowers. Once you have them, journey deep into the forest to the 
"Whispering Glade," where the wind carries the faint whispers of the past. There, you will find a tree near the clearing that marks the place where Garen buried his
sister. Place the flowers near the tree, and he will know that you have completed this task.  

	Reward :

	Quest 2: "The Truth and the Talisman" 
	Objective : 
- Deliver the talisman to Tilda Wavewalker.  
- Dont tll her that Garen is in love with her and that the talisman is a gift for her.  
- Return to Garen after Tilda refuses the gift and advise him to speak with her directly.  
- Go back to "The Whispering Glade" to gather yellow flowers for Garen.  
- Return to the tavern to find Tilda and Garen together.

	Description : 
	Now that you’ve delivered the flowers to Garen’s sister’s resting place, Garen has something he wants you to do. He has crafted a beautiful necklace as a token 
of his affection for Tilda Wavewalker, but his shyness keeps him from telling her the truth. He asks that you deliver it to her, but only on the condition that you 
don’t tell her the truth about the gift—it’s from him, but you must act as though it's just a simple token.  
	However, when you present the talisman to Tilda, she refuses it unless you tell her the truth. She’ll only accept it if she knows it’s from Garen and that he 
loves her. After speaking with Tilda, you’ll need to go back to Garen and report the outcome. He’ll be embarrassed, but he’ll need your help again.  
	Garen asks you to venture into "The Whispering Glade" once more to collect a bundle of yellow flowers, a gesture that will help him confess his feelings to 
Tilda.  
	Once you return with the flowers, you’ll find that things have already changed between them. Tilda and Garen will be together, and Tilda will give you a 
substantial amount of gold for your efforts.
