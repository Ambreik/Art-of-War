			The Rusty Anchor Tavern  
			
	Description : "The Rusty Anchor" is a cozy, bustling tavern filled with the smell of roasted meat and salt air. The interior is decorated with nautical relics: 
old ship wheels, nets hanging from the rafters, and lanterns that sway gently as if still at sea. The large fireplace at one end of the room crackles warmly, 
providing a welcoming glow. The bar is crafted from the wood of an old ship, and its surface is etched with carvings made by drunken sailors over the years. A small 
stage in the corner hosts musicians or storytellers most nights, adding to the lively atmosphere.  

	Staff Members :   
- "Bessy Ironspoon" :  The head cook, a plump and cheerful woman known for her spicy seafood chowder.  
- "Finn "Quickhands" Garver" :  The bartender, a wiry young man with a knack for juggling bottles and mugs to entertain the patrons.  
- "Tilda Wavewalker" :  The waitress, a sharp-tongued but kind-hearted woman who keeps the rowdy patrons in check.  
- "Garen Deepdraft" :  The bouncer, a towering ex-sailor with a missing eye and a booming voice that instantly silences troublemakers.  

		Wide Mechanics Description of The Rusty Anchor Tavern

1. Pet, Mount, Guardian, and Baron Restrictions :   
	- Players cannot summon pets, mounts, Guardians, or Barons inside the tavern. Upon entering, any active summons are automatically dismissed, and the system 
returns them to the player's roster or storage.  

2. Safe Zone Mechanics :   
	- PvP and PK Mode Disabled :  All PvP stances and PK (player-killer) mechanics are automatically disabled inside the tavern. Even players flagged as PK will not
be able to engage in combat while inside. The tavern is a designated "safe zone" for all.  

3. Interactive NPC Table (Sailors’ Table) :   
	- A table near the entrance on the right is occupied by four sailors during the day (7:58 to 23:58).  
	- The sailors drink, laugh, and share randomly generated stories (from a pool of 12 unique tales). Players can overhear these stories, which may contain subtle 
lore, rumors, or flavor details about the region.  
	- Nighttime Behavior :  At 23:58, the sailors vanish mysteriously and reappear at 7:58 in the morning. Their table always remains filled with beer mugs, and 
their animations include gestures like smashing mugs, pointing at each other, jumping from their chairs, and loud laughter.  

4. Drunken Mechanics :   
	- Players can get drunk by consuming drinks purchased from the tavern.  
	- When drunk, players become "tipsy", which affects movement (slight stagger in random directions) and chat (text appears slurred).  
	- Tipsy at Midnight (23:58) :  If a player is tipsy near the sailors’ table at 23:58:  
		- The player collapses on the floor, the screen fades to black for 25 seconds.  
		- When the screen fades back in, the player finds themselves teleported to a "secluded area near a small house" on the other side of the area of the map.  

	*Skeleton Encounter :   
	- Upon being teleported, the area becomes foggy, and packs of zombie skeletons spawn continuously for 15 minutes.  
		- The skeletons do not drop gold or experience but have a chance to drop the "Key of Rescuer", an important item.  
	- Once the key drops, a loud scream sound effect occurs, and a "Giant Berserk Skeleton" spawns.  
		- All other skeletons instantly vanish upon its appearance.  
		- The surroundings become ominously quiet, and the fog thickens.  

	*Giant Berserk Skeleton Mechanics :   
	- The "Giant Berserk Skeleton" engages the player in combat, attacking aggressively with powerful abilities.  
	- If the player succeeds in defeating the skeleton, the surroundings return to normal, and the player can use the "Key of Rescuer" to unlock the door of the 
nearby house.  

	*Rescue Event :   
	- Inside the house, the four sailors are found, hidden and waiting to be rescued.  
	- Reward Mechanics :   
		- Upon rescue, one of the sailors gives the player a random reward or hint :   
		- Hints : Information about mysteries in the region, including:  
			- Hidden treasure in the sea near the docks.  
			- Rare drops from monsters in the forest.  
			- Location of secret quests or events.  
		- Rewards :   
			- One of 5 treasure maps leading to unique loot.  
			- A "strong reagent" for crafting.  
			- A "spawn item" (usable, teleports the player back to the tavern).  
			- A red dye item (used in Tailoring).  
			- 20x "Greater Health Potions".  

5. Music and Sound Effects :   
	- The tavern has a chill, ambient music track during the day that creates a relaxing atmosphere.  
	- At midnight, the music shifts to a slower, eerier tune, enhancing the mysterious nighttime vibe.  
	- At sunrise, the daytime music returns, signaling the end of the nighttime events.  

6. Exclusion from "Fury of Winterspring" Event :   
	- The Rusty Anchor Tavern is not included in the regional event "Fury of Winterspring." This ensures that its mechanics and safe-zone status remain unaffected 
during the event.
