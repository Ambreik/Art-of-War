- Area : The main tavern by the waterfront  

---  

	Appearance : "Rowan" is a stout man in his late 40s, with a thick auburn beard streaked with gray and kind eyes that show a glint of wisdom. He wears a dark 
brown leather apron over a cream-colored tunic, both slightly stained from years of serving hearty meals and strong ale. His sleeves are often rolled up, revealing 
muscular forearms, likely a result of his past life as a sailor. He carries a polished brass tankard clipped to his belt and a heavy keyring hanging from his side. 
His posture is welcoming but firm, a man who commands respect in his tavern.

	Personality : Rowan is warm and approachable, with a hearty laugh and a booming voice that fills the tavern. He’s a natural storyteller, often spinning tales of
the sea and his days aboard merchant ships. Rowan treats regulars like family and newcomers with curiosity, always ready to share a drink and some advice. However, 
he’s also no-nonsense when it comes to tavern rules, maintaining order with a sharp wit and a heavy oak club hanging behind the bar.
