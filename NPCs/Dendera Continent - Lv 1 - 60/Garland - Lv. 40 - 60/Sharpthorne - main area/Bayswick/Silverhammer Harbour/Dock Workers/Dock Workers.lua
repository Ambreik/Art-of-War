			Dock Workers

	Location : "Bayswick Docks" (Spread across the harbor, performing tasks such as unloading ships, carrying cargo, and organizing supplies)

---

	Appearance : The dock workers are rugged and sturdy individuals, each dressed in practical, weathered clothing suited for heavy labor. Their shirts are often 
rolled up at the sleeves, revealing strong, muscular arms marked with scars and tattoos of nautical symbols. Each worker wears a leather belt filled with tools, 
such as small knives, ropes, and hooks. Their boots are thick and scuffed, showing years of wear from working on the docks. Most have sun-tanned skin and faces 
lined with grit, reflecting their hard lives spent working by the sea.

	Personality : The dock workers are hardworking and straightforward, with little patience for nonsense. They are friendly but curt, often cracking jokes among 
themselves or muttering about the next shipment. Each worker has their own unique trait: some are more gruff and grumpy, while others are cheerful and eager to 
share a story or two about life at the harbor. While they may seem rough around the edges, they’re fiercely loyal to their crew and protective of the docks.

	- “Help carry this crate to the storage area.”  
	- “Tie down the ship before the storm rolls in.”  
	- “Deliver this message to the harbor master.”  
	These small tasks provide players with opportunities to earn minor rewards or build relationships with harbor-related NPCs.
