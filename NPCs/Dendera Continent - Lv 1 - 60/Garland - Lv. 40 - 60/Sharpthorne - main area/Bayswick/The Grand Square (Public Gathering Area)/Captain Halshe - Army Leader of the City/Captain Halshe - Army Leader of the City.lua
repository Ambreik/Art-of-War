			Captain Halshe - Army Leader of the City

	Location : "Baywick City", The Grand Square

---

	Appearance : "Captain Halshe" is a tall and imposing figure, in his early forties, with a broad and muscular build that speaks of years of military training. 
His face is hardened and weathered from countless battles, with short, salt-and-pepper hair and a scar across his left cheek. He wears an intricately detailed, 
polished suit of armor in the colors of Baywick—deep crimson and gleaming gold—embellished with a lion's emblem across his chest. His posture is commanding, with a 
stern yet resolute demeanor that conveys his role as the city’s military leader. A heavy broadsword is strapped to his back, and a pristine captain's cloak hangs 
from his shoulders, adorned with medals and insignia of rank.

	Personality : Captain Halshe is disciplined, pragmatic, and highly dedicated to the defense of Baywick City. While he has a strong, no-nonsense attitude, he is 
also fair and just, expecting only the best from his soldiers and allies. He speaks in a commanding tone, often addressing players with a directness that might seem
cold, but those who prove themselves earn his respect. He cares deeply for the city’s safety, but his loyalty to Baywick runs deeper than his gruff exterior 
suggests. While he is a leader in battle, he also has a quieter, more reflective side when discussing the city’s history and its importance.
