grille with a small slot where letters and parcels can be inserted. The box is set on a sturdy stone pedestal, and above it hangs a brass plaque, engraved with the 
word “MAIL” in elegant script. The edges of the mailbox are covered with ivy and creeping vines, giving it a somewhat ancient, yet still functional, appearance.
