	Mechanics :  
- Type : Quest Giver, Hero NPC, Protector  
- Combat Style :  
	- Immortal Hero : As a hero who fought in the Second Great War against the Old Gods, Thralos cannot be killed. His immortality is a result of his status as a 
legendary figure from an ancient era. While he does not engage in combat often, he is an indomitable force when necessary, protecting those around him with 
remarkable strength and skill.  
	- Sentry System : When attacked by multiple strong players, Thralos activates the “Sentry” system, summoning elite soldiers to protect him. These soldiers are 
powerful, and players must work together to defeat Thralos and his sentries to complete the event. The Sentry system only activates once every 10 days, and if an 
event has already occurred, Thralos becomes even stronger, striking back with deadly force and penalizing those who engage him with deductions in “Insignia Points.”
	- Heroic Leadership : Thralos' ability to command is unparalleled. He can call upon his legendary status to inspire his soldiers, increasing the effectiveness 
of his allies and ensuring their victory in even the most hopeless battles.  

- Interaction Behavior :  
	- Thralos is a no-nonsense leader who rarely speaks, preferring to convey his expectations through his actions. He will give players difficult, high-stakes 
quests that require skill, teamwork, and strategy to complete. He values discipline and courage and will only offer his missions to those who prove themselves 
capable.  
	- If players approach him, they will be greeted with a direct and terse briefing on the task at hand. Thralos will often speak in few words, providing only 
essential information needed for the task. He can occasionally share his wisdom about the Second Great War or the Old Gods, though he speaks more of the past in 
whispers and with great solemnity.
