			Brother Eldwin - Wandering Scholar

	Location : "Baywick City", The Grand Square  

---

	Appearance : Brother Eldwin is an older, somewhat disheveled man with a thin frame and a slightly hunched back. He wears the robes of a scholar, though they are
faded and worn from years of travel. His glasses are often perched precariously on the tip of his nose,and he carries a small satchel filled with books and scrolls.
His face is lined with age, but his bright, inquisitive eyes shine with a passion for knowledge. Despite his frail appearance, he seems to have an unrelenting 
desire to uncover secrets, often muttering to himself in excitement.

---

	Personality : Eldwin is friendly and approachable, always eager to share his vast knowledge with those who show interest. He is humble and somewhat absent-
minded, often getting lost in his thoughts or caught up in the excitement of his research. His kindness is tempered by his cowardice, as he is easily frightened and
will panic if threatened. He can be somewhat forgetful at times, but his heart is in the right place. He values knowledge above all else, and is always excited to 
find others who are curious about the mysteries of the world. end

	Role :  
- Role(s) : Quest Chain Starter, Repeatable Quest Giver  
	Brother Eldwin begins a long quest chain for players, focused on the recovery of lost tomes scattered throughout Baywick. This quest chain delves into 
uncovering a forgotten magical conspiracy tied to the Grand Square. His quests often lead to new discoveries and unlock further storylines as the player progresses.
	Additionally, every last Sunday night of the month, Eldwin offers a Repeatable Chain Quest to those who approach him with an "Apple" fruit between **23:58**
and **23:59** in Baywick City. This event unlocks unique rewards for those able to meet the conditions.

	Mechanics :  
- Type : Quest Giver, Non-Combat NPC  
- Reputation Impact :  
	- Attacking Eldwin multiple times will cause him to stop providing quests, and players will lose reputation with the city, as he is a key figure for reputation 
gains with other NPCs in Baywick.  
- Interaction Limitations :  
	- Repeatable Chain Quest can only be activated on the last Sunday night of each month with an "Apple" fruit, within the exact time window (23:58-23:59).  
	- Eldwin does not provide quests to players who have attacked him consecutively, as this negatively impacts city reputation.
	- Teleportation Service : If approached with a "Crystaline Rose", Eldwin can teleport players to different locations across the World Map, even to other 
continents (excluding pirate-controlled areas). The player selects the destination on the World Map during interaction.

	Skills :  
- Teleportation (with Crystaline Rose)  
	- Description : Eldwin will teleport the player to any location on the World Map (excluding pirate-controlled areas). The player simply selects the destination 
while interacting with him, and Eldwin uses his magical knowledge to transport them.  
	- Effect : Opens up fast travel across the map, easing the journey for players who have earned his trust.  

- Cowardice (when attacked  
	- Description : Upon being attacked, Eldwin will panic, screaming and running through the streets of Baywick in a chaotic fashion. This behavior is comical and 
unexpected, but also showcases his complete lack of combat skills.  
	- Effect : Eldwin runs away, trying to avoid further confrontation.

	Behavior :  
- Eldwin is mostly stationary, often seen pacing around the Grand Square as he collects his thoughts or speaks to nearby townsfolk. His cowardice becomes evident 
when threatened—if attacked, he will panic, scream, and attempt to flee, running through the streets in a comical, frantic manner. Players may be surprised to see 
him running at top speed, much to the amusement of those who watch.  
- If attacked multiple times, Eldwin will not provide quests, and his ability to teleport players will also be revoked, signaling his distress and rejection of the 
player.

   - "Ah, a fellow seeker of knowledge! The lost tomes... they are so much more than dusty pages. Come, I have a tale to tell, and a mystery to uncover."  
   - "I've stumbled upon something far beyond my understanding. Will you help me, or should I continue searching blindly?"  
   - "You’ve found the first step of a much larger puzzle. I will guide you, but be warned, there are forces that seek to keep these secrets buried."

- When threatened or attacked:  
   - "What madness is this?! Help! Someone, please!"  
   - "I’ve no strength for battle, leave me be!"  
   - "Not again! Why does this keep happening?!" (He then runs off, in a flurry of panic.)
