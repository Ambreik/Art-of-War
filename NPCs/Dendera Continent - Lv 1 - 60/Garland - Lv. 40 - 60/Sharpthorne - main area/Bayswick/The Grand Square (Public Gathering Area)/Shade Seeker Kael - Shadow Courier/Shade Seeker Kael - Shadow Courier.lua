	Location : "Baywick City", The Grand Square

---

	Appearance : "Kael is a lithe and enigmatic figure cloaked in dark, form-fitting armor that seems to blend into the shadows around him. His pale complexion 
contrasts sharply with his jet-black hair, which is tied back in a loose ponytail. His eyes glint with an eerie crimson hue, constantly scanning his surroundings as
though he is always a step ahead. A series of small throwing knives are strapped to his belt, and a curved, ornate dagger rests at his side, glowing faintly with a 
shadowy aura. His movements are precise and silent, his posture exuding confidence and arrogance. He is the embodiment of secrecy and danger, with an aura that 
makes others feel both intimidated and intrigued.

	Personality : Kael is arrogant and dismissive toward all non-ninja classes, often making cutting remarks or sarcastic comments about their lack of subtlety or skill. However, when dealing with ninja players, his demeanor shifts entirely. He is respectful, encouraging, and even protective, offering sage advice and 
acknowledging their potential as equals or future masters of stealth. Kael's words are often shrouded in riddles or metaphors, and he never reveals more than he 
intends to, keeping his motives and allegiances mysterious. Despite his arrogance, he occasionally interacts with other races, offering cryptic advice that hints at
deeper knowledge of the city’s hidden truths.
