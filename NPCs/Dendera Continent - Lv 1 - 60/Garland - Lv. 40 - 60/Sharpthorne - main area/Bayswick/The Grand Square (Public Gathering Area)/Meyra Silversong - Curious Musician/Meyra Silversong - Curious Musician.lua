			Meyra Silversong - Curious Musician

	Location : "Baywick City", The Grand Square

---

	Appearance : Meyra Silversong is a graceful and intriguing wandering bard, always seen with a lute slung over her shoulder and a mischievous twinkle in her eye.
Her long, silver hair flows freely, giving her a carefree yet ethereal appearance. She dresses in a mix of colorful fabrics, with intricate designs that reflect her
creative spirit, and a silver pendant shaped like a musical note rests at her neck. Her bright eyes seem to constantly observe the world, as if she’s always 
pondering some deeper meaning or story. Her expression often flickers between playful curiosity and profound contemplation, reflecting her tendency to ask thought-
provoking questions.

	Personality : Meyra is the opposite of her brother, Taven. While he is a rugged and pragmatic hunter, she is gentle, curious, and full of philosophical musings.
She enjoys posing strange, often humorous questions to those she meets, leading them into quests that challenge their thinking and understanding of the world. She 
has a way of making even the most serious of topics feel light-hearted and fun. Meyra is not wicked or cruel like her brother, but she certainly has a mischievous 
side. She delights in playing with her victims (or rather, her quests) and weaving stories that surprise and entertain. She has a deep love for history, 
storytelling, and the mysteries of the world, often using these themes in her quests. Though she may occasionally turn the tables on players by "hunting" them in 
the shadows, she’s generally a playful and harmless figure. Her soft laughter and light-hearted nature often follow after a twist in one of her quests.

and often humorous conclusions. She may send players to uncover the hidden stories of historical figures, NPCs, or locations, and these quests often come with 
surprising twists. Although she doesn’t specialize in combat, she can become a shadowy figure and hunt down players, though it’s a rare occurrence, and when it does

	Mechanics :  
- Type : Quest Giver, Shadow Hunter (Occasional)  
- Combat Style :  
	- Shadow of Curiosity : Meyra has a rare ability to turn into a shadow, becoming untargetable for a brief period. When this happens, she may attempt to "hunt" a
player. However, her strength in this form is much weaker compared to Taven, and it is more of a playful chase than a serious threat.If a player is defeated by her,
she rewards them with a special item or knowledge.  
	- Lute of Enchantment : While not directly combat-focused, Meyra can use her lute to cast minor enchantments or illusions, such as charming NPCs for a brief 
period or altering the environment to confuse her foes. This is more of a distraction technique, designed to throw off attackers or make her quests more 
entertaining.  

- Interaction Behavior :  
	- When players approach her, Meyra greets them with a warm smile, often asking a random philosophical question or puzzling riddle. She delights in seeing how 
players respond to her odd queries, and these answers will determine what kind of quest she gives.  
	- While she is not as dangerous as her brother, if a player attacks her, she may transform into a shadow and briefly chase them around, although she won’t deal 
deadly damage. This behavior is rare but adds an element of surprise when it occurs.  
	- Most of her quests revolve around exploring the stories of historical figures or NPCs in the game, sometimes leading players to uncover forgotten legends or 
solve strange mysteries tied to the city or other regions.

	Behavior :  
- When interacting with players, Meyra will often start with a question, such as “If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?” or “What would you do if you could change one event in history?” These questions are more than just idle musings—they’re the starting points for the bizarre
and often humorous quests she assigns.  
- Occasionally, she will pose a challenge to the player in the form of a riddle or puzzle, and the answer they give may affect the outcome of the quest. Meyra 
enjoys testing the limits of logic, and she frequently plays with the players’ expectations.  
- While she is not a dangerous NPC, if players attack her, she will transform into a shadow and chase them around. However, her strength is limited, and she won’t 
go out of her way to kill anyone. If the player defeats her, she will reward them with something special, often an item or a unique piece of lore.

	Quotes :  
- Upon first meeting a player:  
	- "Ah, a traveler. Tell me, what would you do if you were to live forever? Would you cherish every moment, or let time slip through your fingers?"  
	- "The world is full of stories, some dark, some light. Would you care to hear one, or perhaps write your own?"  
- When giving a quest:  
	- "I have a little puzzle for you. Find the missing piece to this riddle, and you shall find your way to a treasure."  
	- "Not all quests are what they seem. Sometimes, the real challenge is discovering what’s hidden beneath the surface."  
- When attacking a player:  
	- "Oh, I see you’ve chosen to fight, haven’t you? Very well, let’s see how well you can handle the shadows."  
	- "You can try to defeat me, but I don’t think you’re ready for this dance."  
- After being defeated:  
	- "Well played, traveler. Perhaps there is more to you than I thought. Here’s something for your trouble."
