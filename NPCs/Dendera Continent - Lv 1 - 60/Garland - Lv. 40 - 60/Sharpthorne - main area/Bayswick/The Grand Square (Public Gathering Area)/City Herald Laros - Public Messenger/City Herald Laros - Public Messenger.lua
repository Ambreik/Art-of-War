with rolled-up scrolls and sealed letters. His face often bears a serious expression, but his eyes glint with an intelligent curiosity, always scanning for new 
stories or important news.

	Personality : Laros is highly professional and straightforward in his demeanor, but he also has a knack for storytelling when discussing the latest news or

a bit guarded about his own personal affairs, preferring to focus on the duties of his office. While not overly warm, he is respectful and knows the value of a well
-timed message or piece of information.
