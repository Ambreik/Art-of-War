			Ardin Bloodshade - Keeper of the Veil

	Location : "Baywick City", The Grand Square

---

	Appearance : Ardin is a tall, elegant figure dressed in finely tailored noble attire, featuring a dark crimson overcoat embroidered with silver patterns 
resembling veils of mist. His pale, flawless complexion contrasts with his piercing, glowing red eyes, which seem to peer into a person’s soul. His jet-black hair 
is neatly combed back, and he carries an ornate silver-tipped cane that doubles as a weapon. Despite his composed demeanor, there’s an unsettling air about him, as 
if danger lurks just beneath his refined exterior. At night, his appearance becomes even more haunting, with faint traces of shadows clinging to his form and an 
eerie mist following in his wake.

	Personality : Ardin exudes charm and sophistication, speaking with eloquence and a calm, measured tone. To vampire players, he is welcoming and treats them as 
kin, often offering guidance on embracing their vampiric nature and maneuvering through the web of political intrigue. To non-vampire players, he is distant, his 
politeness laced with a subtle menace that keeps others on edge. At night, his playful yet predatory side emerges, as he enjoys unnerving those who cross his path 
with sudden appearances and cryptic remarks. Despite his unsettling tendencies, Ardin is fiercely loyal to his kind and will go to great lengths to protect the 
secrets of vampire heritage.
