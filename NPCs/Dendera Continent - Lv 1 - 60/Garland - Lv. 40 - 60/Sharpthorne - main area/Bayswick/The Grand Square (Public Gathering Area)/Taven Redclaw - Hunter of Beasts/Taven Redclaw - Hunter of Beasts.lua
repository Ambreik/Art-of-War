	Location : "Baywick City", The Grand Square

---

	Appearance : Taven Redclaw is a rugged, weathered ranger with the look of a man who has spent his life tracking and hunting dangerous beasts. His long, unkempt 
hair is dark and streaked with gray, and his piercing green eyes reflect a sharp focus that only a seasoned hunter possesses. He wears a mixture of leather armor 
and furs, designed for both mobility and protection in the wilderness. His outfit is adorned with various hunting trophies, including claws and teeth from the 
creatures he's slain. A bow and a quiver of arrows are slung across his back, and a dagger with a serrated edge hangs from his belt. His expression is often one of 
quiet determination, but there's a glint of mischief in his eyes, especially when he’s orchestrating one of his hunts.

	Personality : Taven is a seasoned hunter with a knack for making even the most dangerous tasks seem like a game. He’s often sarcastic and playful, especially 
when interacting with players. He has a dry sense of humor, frequently playing pranks on those who think they can outsmart him. Taven enjoys the thrill of the hunt,
both in terms of the creatures he tracks and the challenges he presents to others. However, behind his gruff exterior lies a deep respect for nature and the beasts
he hunts. He’s not just a monster slayer—he’s someone who understands the balance of the world and the role that hunting plays in it. Taven is also a bit of a 
trickster, often setting up quests that require a little more effort than expected, but he rewards those who rise to the challenge with a sense of accomplishment.

- Combat Style :  
	- Hunter's Ambush : Taven is a skilled ranger, adept at tracking and setting traps. He has a unique ability to "disappear" into the shadows, becoming 
untargetable for a short period, and will use this skill to strike back at those who attack him unexpectedly. When a player attacks him, he vanishes into the 
shadows, only to reappear when the attacker has let their guard down, often delivering a surprise strike. He is capable of dealing significant damage when he does 
so, and may even kill the player if they are unprepared.
	- Beast's Wrath : Taven's hunting skills allow him to summon a temporary companion in the form of a fierce beast that aids him in combat, attacking his enemies 
with deadly precision.

occasionally challenge them with his witty remarks. If attacked, Taven will make himself untargetable and invisible for a short while, before reappearing to strike 
back, sometimes dealing fatal damage to the player.  
	- Taven has a knack for turning the tables on anyone who thinks they can outsmart him. In exchange for a treat or favor, he might offer players quests to 
strange and difficult locations, where they will find bottles with letters containing messages from Taven. These letters often mock the player or provide a clue to 
the next difficult task ahead. It’s a game of wits and resilience.
