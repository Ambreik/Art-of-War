	Location : "Governor’s Hall", Bayswick  

---

	Appearance : "The Silverguard Sentinel" is a tall, muscular figure, wearing polished silver armor with intricate blue accents that match the city’s colors. A 
helm with a sharp, angular design covers most of their face, leaving only the eyes visible—cold and watchful. They carry a large halberd, and their posture is 
always at attention, standing tall and imposing beside the Governor. Their armor gleams in the daylight, reflecting their disciplined nature and unwavering loyalty 
to the Governor.

	Personality : "The Silverguard Sentinel" is stoic and vigilant, speaking only when necessary. They have an unwavering loyalty to Governor Erdanis and show 
little tolerance for disruptions. Though they rarely speak, their presence alone commands respect, and they have an air of quiet authority. Despite their silent 
demeanor, they are always on alert, ready to defend the Governor at a moment’s notice.

	Mechanics :  
- Type : Guard NPC  
- Reputation : N/A (Loyal to Governor Erdanis, part of city security)  
- Interaction Limitations : Can be interacted with by players who have access to the Governor’s Hall or the Governor. Typically non-interactive unless certain conditions in the storyline trigger dialogue or events.  
- PvP : Not flagged for PvP. Engaging with them or attacking them results in hostile retaliation from the city guards.  
- Respawn Time : Instant respawn (guards remain at their post unless the storyline or an event requires their departure).  
- Other Mechanics : The Silverguard Sentinel’s main function is protection. They will engage enemies or hostile NPCs in the vicinity with their halberds. They may 
issue warnings to players with low reputation or high suspicion. If the player has high favor with the Governor, they may be allowed brief conversations for special
interactions. They also provide support in major city events, especially those related to the Governor’s storyline quests.
