	Personality : Kalath is a quiet, introspective individual, deeply invested in the preservation of history and the ancient texts she guards. She speaks slowly,

there is a sharpness in her gaze when she speaks about her work, as if daring anyone to question the importance of the past. She is welcoming to those who show 
respect for the knowledge she holds but is wary of those who seek to exploit it for personal gain. Kalath values patience and the pursuit of knowledge above all 
else.
