			Silverguard Watcher - Guard 2

	Location : "Governor’s Hall", Bayswick  

---

	Appearance : Slightly shorter but equally formidable, the Silverguard Watcher wears the same highly polished silver armor, with a more practical design that 
includes a short sword sheathed at their side. The Watcher’s face is partly covered by a cloth mask, but their sharp eyes scan the surroundings constantly, always 
on the lookout for threats. They carry a round shield adorned with the Bayswick emblem, providing both defense and intimidation. The Watcher has a more agile build 
compared to the Sentinel, but their quick reflexes make them just as deadly in combat.

	Personality : "The Silverguard Watcher" is more approachable but no less focused. They are observant and quick to react, often offering brief but authoritative 
words when interacting with others. They show respect for those who have earned it, but their primary duty is to the Governor’s safety, which they take seriously. 
While more willing to engage in conversation than their counterpart, they remain composed and professional, ensuring the Governor is never caught off-guard.

	Mechanics :  
- Type : Guard NPC  
- Reputation : N/A (Loyal to Governor Erdanis, part of city security)  
- Interaction Limitations : Can be interacted with by players who have access to the Governor’s Hall or the Governor. Typically non-interactive unless certain conditions in the storyline trigger dialogue or events.  
- PvP : Not flagged for PvP. Attacking the Watcher results in hostile retaliation from the guards of Bayswick.  
- Respawn Time : Instant respawn (guards remain at their post unless the storyline or an event requires their departure).  
- Other Mechanics : The Silverguard Watcher is equally protective, ready to respond to any threats to the Governor. They provide security in the city, especially 
near important events or when the Governor is out and about. They may also issue warnings or alerts to players who are acting suspiciously or who are seen entering 
restricted areas. The Watcher will only engage in combat if necessary but is a formidable defender of the Governor.
