			Trainer Garth – Mount Handler 

	Location : "Irvien Stable" Northern Side of the Region  

---  

	Appearance : A broad-shouldered man with a muscular frame, Trainer Garth looks every bit like someone who has wrestled with the most stubborn of mounts. His 
short, dark hair is streaked with gray, and a jagged scar runs across his left cheek—a reminder of an unruly beast from years past. His arms are covered in leather 
braces to protect against stray kicks, and his rough hands bear the callouses of a lifetime spent handling creatures far larger than himself. He wears a reinforced 
riding vest with sturdy boots, always prepared for the next challenge. His eyes are sharp, always assessing the confidence (or lack thereof) in those who approach 
him.  

---  

	Personality : Garth is direct, no-nonsense, and expects people to pull their weight. He values effort and skill over words, and he has little patience for those
who complain about their mounts being "too difficult." Though he might come across as harsh, he genuinely wants riders to improve, believing that true mastery comes
from persistence. He has a dry sense of humor and enjoys seeing cocky riders humbled by their own overconfidence.

	Quotes :  
- "A real rider doesn’t blame the mount. You think it’s stubborn? Maybe it just doesn’t respect you."  
- "Seen too many riders hit the dirt ‘cause they thought they could overpower a beast with brute strength. It doesn’t work that way."  
- "Your mount ain’t just a tool. You work *with* it, not against it."  
- "If you can’t hold your seat when the wind howls and the ground shakes, then you’re not ready for the real ride."  
- "I don’t train amateurs. Either you’re serious about improving, or you’re just wasting my time."  
- "You’re gonna fall. That’s a guarantee. What matters is whether you get back up."  
- "Every great rider has been thrown off at least a dozen times. If you haven't hit the ground yet, you’re either lucky… or overdue."  
- "Want to be a master rider? Then stop relying on luck and start relying on skill."  
- "Some of the best riders I know started out as the worst. The difference? They didn’t quit."  
- "Taming’s just the start. Control is where the real skill comes in."  
- "If your mount doesn’t trust you, it’ll never listen. And if it doesn’t listen, well… enjoy eating dirt."
