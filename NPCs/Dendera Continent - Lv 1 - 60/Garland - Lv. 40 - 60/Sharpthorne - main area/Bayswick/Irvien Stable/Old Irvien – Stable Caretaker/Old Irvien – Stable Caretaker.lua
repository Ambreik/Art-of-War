			Old Irvien – Stable Caretaker  

	Location : "Irvien Stable", Northern Side of the Region 

---  

	Appearance : Old Irvien is a rugged yet kind-looking elderly man, well into his sixties, with a strong, weathered build that speaks of years spent handling 
powerful beasts. His long, silver hair is often tied back in a loose ponytail, and his thick beard is streaked with gray. Dressed in a sturdy leather coat lined 
with fur, he always carries a wooden cane—more for keeping unruly mounts in check than for supporting himself. His deep-set brown eyes are filled with wisdom, and 
he has a deep, soothing voice that seems to calm both animals and people alike.  

---  

	Personality : Old Irvien is a patient and experienced caretaker who has seen more beasts than most adventurers will in their lifetime. Though he is strict about
how mounts are treated, he holds no bias against newcomers, offering guidance to anyone willing to listen. He has a warm, fatherly demeanor and loves to share 
stories about legendary creatures he has encountered. However, he has little patience for reckless riders who mistreat their mounts.

	Quotes :  
- "A mount is more than just a beast you ride—it’s a companion. Treat ‘em right, and they’ll never let you down." 
- "A strong hand won’t win over a wild beast. It’s patience that tames the untamable." 
- "Not every creature is meant to be ridden, and not every rider deserves a mount. Earn their trust first, or you’ll find yourself in the dirt." 
- "If you can hear the rhythm of a creature’s heart, you’ll never lose control of the reins." 
- "Back when I was younger, I tamed a Thunderhorn with nothing but my wits and a few roots. Hah! Those were the days!" 
- "You’re looking for a rare beast? I might have a few stories to share... if you’ve got the patience to listen." 
- "The biggest mistake greenhorns make? Rushing the bond. No beast worth riding will trust you overnight." 
- "It’s not about breaking their spirit, lad. It’s about understanding it." 
- "I sell tools that *help*, not tools that *force*. You want to tame a beast? Do it the right way." 
- "The creatures here may be trained, but they ain't yours until they choose to be. Respect earns loyalty." 
- "Some mounts need a firm hand. Others need a gentle touch. The trick is knowing which is which." 
- "You think you’re ready for a real mount? Hah! Come back when you’ve been thrown off at least ten times."
