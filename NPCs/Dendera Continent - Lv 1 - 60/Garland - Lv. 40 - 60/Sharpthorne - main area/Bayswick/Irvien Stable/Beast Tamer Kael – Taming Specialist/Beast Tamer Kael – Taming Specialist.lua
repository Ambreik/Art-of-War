Beast Tamer Kael has a rugged and weathered appearance. His long, wild hair and beard are streaked with shades of gray, yet his eyes remain sharp and alert, constantly scanning the horizon for potential creatures to tame. He wears a simple leather vest and trousers, both covered in patches from his many encounters with wild beasts. A belt of various tools for handling animals hangs from his waist, including ropes, snares, and vials of calming elixirs. Kael’s hands are rough and calloused, though gentle when handling even the most dangerous of creatures.
