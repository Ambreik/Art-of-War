			Mirella the Deceptive  

	Location : The Grand Square, Baywick City (Only Active at Night)  

---  

	Appearance : Mirella is a striking woman with deep auburn hair cascading over her shoulders, often partially covering her sharp, calculating golden eyes. She 
wears a sleek, form-fitting cloak with deep violet patterns resembling twisting vines. Her fingers are adorned with elegant rings, some enchanted, and her movements
are like a dancer’s—graceful and unpredictable.  

---  

	Personality : Mirella is clever, manipulative, and enjoys a well-executed deception more than outright theft. Unlike Fennick, who finds joy in trickery, she 
enjoys winning—whether through charm, wit, or sheer audacity. She has a talent for reading people and making them believe whatever she wants. If someone is smart 
enough to challenge her at her own game, she’ll respect them—if only a little.

- If a player successfully resists her deception, she rewards them with a minor challenge quest.  
- Unlike Fennick, she rarely fights directly, preferring to manipulate and then disappear.
