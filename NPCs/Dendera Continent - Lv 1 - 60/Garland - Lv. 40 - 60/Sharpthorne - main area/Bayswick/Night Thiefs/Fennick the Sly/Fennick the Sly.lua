			Fennick the Sly  

	Location : The Grand Square, Baywick City (Only Active at Night)  

---  

	Appearance : Fennick is a lean and agile man dressed in dark, tattered noble clothing with a flamboyant red sash tied around his waist. His short, messy black 
hair barely covers the mischievous glint in his sharp green eyes. He wears several rings, some stolen and some won in high-stakes trickery, and his leather boots 
barely make a sound as he moves. His entire presence radiates an air of unpredictability.  

---  

	Personality : Fennick is a silver-tongued trickster who thrives on deception, misdirection, and quick getaways. He enjoys toying with people, especially 
travelers who seem too confident in their own abilities. Despite his dishonest nature, he has his own twisted sense of honor—he never steals from the poor, and he 
finds joy in a good challenge rather than just easy targets.  

---  

	Behavior :  
- Fennick moves erratically through the city square at night, often vanishing into the shadows before appearing again elsewhere.  
- He occasionally targets players who are idling, tricking them into duels, fake trades, or outright theft.  
- If he successfully steals an item, the player receives it back later via in-game mail (with a taunting note).  
- If a player fights back, he warps unpredictably and counterattacks with speed, making him difficult to kill.  
- Unlike regular criminals, he is not pursued by the city guards.

- Event NPC : Appears in special events (like festivals) to run high-stakes betting games.
