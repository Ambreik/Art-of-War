			Dog – Argos

	Appearance : Argos is a large, muscular dog with shaggy fur that blends into the lake’s surroundings. His fur is mostly dark brown with black patches, giving 
him a rugged, wild look. His eyes are a piercing amber, and he has a strong, confident posture that suggests he's both protective and loyal. Argos is often seen 
trotting by Brolan’s side, occasionally resting near the fishing dock. He’s a quick and agile creature, always alert to any movement nearby.
