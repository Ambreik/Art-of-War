			Joro – The Apprentice

	Location : "Lake Haven", Southern Boundary of Sharpthorne

---

	Appearance : Joro is a young, energetic boy, no older than fifteen, with short, messy brown hair and a face full of enthusiasm. He’s always seen with a wide 
grin plastered on his face, a combination of mischief and excitement in his bright green eyes. His clothes are simple—hand-me-downs from his parents—but they're 
always clean, though often a little too big for him. Joro's hands are usually busy fiddling with small trinkets or maps, always planning his next adventure or 
mischief.

---

	Personality : Joro is an eager, curious boy with an insatiable appetite for exploration. He’s constantly running around, getting into trouble, and talking about
the next big discovery he’s going to make. He looks up to the adults around him but often feels the need to prove himself by taking on tasks that seem far too 
dangerous for his age. His mischievous streak often gets him into trouble, and he has a knack for making promises to players that are hard to keep, often promising 
rewards that he "may or may not" have already stolen from others.

	Behavior :  
- Joro is almost always seen running around, his energy never seeming to tire.  
- He can often be heard calling out to adventurers, asking for help with various tasks, though he rarely follows through on his promises.  
- When he’s not running around, he’s usually found chatting with Brolan or trying to sneak a fish out of the lake.  
- Joro’s quick wit and charm often help him talk his way out of sticky situations, but he’s also known to get into trouble with the adults when his antics go too 
far.

	Quotes :  
- "If you want the best stuff, you gotta know where to look... or know *who* to look at!"  
- "I bet I can beat you to that spot over there. I’ll bet *something* valuable!"

- "You can trust me—just don’t tell Brolan, okay?"
