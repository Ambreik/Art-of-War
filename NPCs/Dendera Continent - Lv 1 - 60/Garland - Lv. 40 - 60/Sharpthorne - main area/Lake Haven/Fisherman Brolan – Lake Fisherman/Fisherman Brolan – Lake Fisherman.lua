			Fisherman Brolan – Lake Fisherman

	Location : "Lake Haven", Southern Boundary of Sharpthorne

	Appearance : Fisherman Brolan is a rugged middle-aged man with a strong, weathered build. His tanned skin shows years of exposure to the elements, particularly 
the sun’s glare from the lake’s surface. His beard is thick but unkempt, and his deep blue eyes have the calm, reflective quality of someone who spends his days by 
the water. He wears a loose, faded shirt and trousers with a sturdy belt where he hangs various fishing tools. His boots are worn, perfect for standing in the 
shallows, and he always carries a large fishing net draped over his shoulder. A small, wooden tackle box sits beside him where he works on maintaining his gear.

	Personality : Brolan is patient and wise, with a quiet demeanor that matches the tranquil environment of Lake Haven. He speaks slowly, his voice carrying the 
weight of experience. Despite his serious approach to fishing and maintaining the lake, he has a soft spot for helping newcomers to the craft. He knows everything 
there is to know about the local fish and the best spots to cast a line, and he’s always willing to share his expertise with anyone who shows interest. Brolan has a
no-nonsense attitude toward his work, but he's also known to tell amusing stories about past fishing trips when he's in the mood.
