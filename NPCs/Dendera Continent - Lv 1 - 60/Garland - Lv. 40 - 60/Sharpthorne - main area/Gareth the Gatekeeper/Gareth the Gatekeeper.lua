			Gareth the Gatekeeper  
	
	Location : Bayswick (for Knights) or Fortress of Eldergate (for Pindars)  

	Description : "Gareth the Gatekeeper" is a solitary, enigmatic figure who serves as the only connection between the mortal world and the cursed 
realm of the "Unholy Temples". A seasoned protector, he lives in a humble stone house nestled deep within the forests near the teleportation points of
both "Bayswick" and the "Fortress of Eldergate". His dwelling, although modest in structure, is solid and weathered, with moss-covered stone walls and
a low, arched roof. The house is surrounded by the dense trees of the forest, their ancient branches casting shadows over the small, well-worn path 
that leads up to his door.  

	Two large, imposing dogs are always by his side, guardians of both the house and the gate. These dogs, with fur the color of ash and eyes that 
glow faintly in the dark, are as much a part of the mysterious aura surrounding Gareth as the gate he protects. Their presence alone serves as a 
warning to any who might try to approach the house uninvited, their growls low and ominous as they watch intruders with unwavering focus. Though they 
appear ferocious, Gareth’s calm demeanor suggests an understanding with these creatures, as if they are not merely guardians but loyal companions in 
his secluded life.  end

	Gareth himself is a tall, broad-shouldered man, with weathered skin that speaks of many years spent in the wilderness. His face, though stern and 
unreadable, holds a certain weariness, as though he has seen things most would rather forget. His hair, long and silvered with age, is kept back by a 
simple cloth band, and his sharp, piercing eyes seem to observe everything with a quiet, knowing wisdom. He carries an intricately carved staff—its 
wood darkened by time—and a glowing orb rests atop it, pulsing with a strange, otherworldly energy. This staff is his tool for channeling the power 
that keeps the gate to the "Unholy Temples" secure, and it is through his vigilant watch that the barrier between the realms remains intact.  

	While his exterior remains stoic and enigmatic, there is a certain sadness that lingers in his eyes—a shadow of something lost, something he has 
come to terms with in his long years of service. Gareth speaks rarely, but when he does, his voice is deep and carries a subtle weight, as though he 
is acutely aware of the dark forces he oversees. He offers the adventurers a "Ticket of Passage" to the "Unholy Temples" with strict warnings: the 
time limit for entry is two hours, and after that, the gate will close, and adventurers must wait another two hours before they can return. This rule 
is enforced, as Gareth understands the perilous nature of the place, and though he may seem indifferent, there is a clear respect for the dangers that
lie within.  

	Gareth’s role is vital. He is not just a keeper of the gate but a custodian of balance, ensuring that the boundary between realms is never crossed
without caution. He has lived in this secluded place for longer than most can fathom, bound to the mysterious forces that created the Unholy Temples. 
His loyalty lies with the realm, not with any single faction, and it is said that he has witnessed countless adventurers come and go, each one leaving
their mark on the world, though none ever stay.  

	To those who approach, Gareth gives little in terms of comfort, but his presence is undeniable. He is the final checkpoint before the unknown, the
last moment of peace before stepping into a world of darkness and danger. And while he may never show it, his role as Gatekeeper is a solemn duty he 
bears with quiet resolve, knowing that the price of access to the Unholy Temples is far steeper than many realize.  

	Atmosphere :    
The air around Gareth’s dwelling is thick with the scents of pine and damp earth, and the quiet sounds of the forest are broken only by the occasional
low growl of his dogs or the rustle of leaves in the wind. Despite the tranquility of his home, there is an undeniable sense of tension in the air. 
The gate to the Unholy Temples is not a mere passage—it is a thin veil separating this world from something darker, and Gareth, standing at its 
threshold, holds the key.  

	Interaction with Players :    
Upon approach, players will find Gareth standing quietly outside his stone house, leaning on his staff. When spoken to, his responses are brief but 
precise, offering just enough information to guide adventurers on their journey. There is no warmth in his words, but neither is there hostility—just 
a calm, quiet acknowledgment of the task at hand. Should players wish to enter the Unholy Temples, he will offer them a "Ticket of Passage", a small 
token that glows faintly with dark magic. However, once the ticket is handed over, the gate opens, and the adventurer is bound to the two-hour limit, 
after which they will be forced to leave, regardless of their progress.  

	While his demeanor remains stoic, a careful observer might notice that Gareth’s eyes follow players as they depart, as though seeing something 
beyond the mortal realm. There is a sense that Gareth knows the fate of all who enter, even if he does not speak it aloud. end
