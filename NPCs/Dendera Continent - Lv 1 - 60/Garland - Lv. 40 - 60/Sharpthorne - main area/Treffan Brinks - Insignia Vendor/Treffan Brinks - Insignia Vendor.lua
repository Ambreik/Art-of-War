			Treffan Brinks - Insignia Vendor  

	Location : Sharpthorne, outside the city of Baywick  

---

	Appearance : Treffan Brinks is a middle-aged man with a rugged, battle-worn look. His face carries scars from past encounters, and his deep-set amber eyes 
always seem to be scanning his surroundings. He wears a long, dark leather coat with reinforced plating on the shoulders and a tattered crimson scarf wrapped 
loosely around his neck. His belt is lined with small pouches, likely containing rare trinkets and currency. Strapped to his back is a heavy satchel filled with 
valuable goods, and his hands are covered in fingerless gloves, revealing calloused knuckles. His presence alone exudes the air of someone who has been through 
countless battles and lived to tell the tale.

	Personality : Treffan is a quiet and no-nonsense vendor who values strength and determination. He doesn’t engage in small talk and only acknowledges players who
have proven themselves in combat. He has a strong sense of business and will not entertain negotiations or discounts.His responses are often short and to the point,
and he expects players to know what they want before approaching him. Despite his rough demeanor, Treffan respects those who earn their insignias through hard work,
and he will only trade with those who have proven their worth.
