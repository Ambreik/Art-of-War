			Dockworker – Rolf "Rusty" Baines  
	
	Location : "Greencoast Wharf" – Dockside

---

	Appearance :  
- Age: Late 30s  
- Attire: A stained, worn-out shirt and trousers, often accompanied by a thick jacket that smells faintly of ale. His clothes are frayed from years of use.  
- Distinguishing Features: A scruffy beard, a red nose from constant drinking, and bloodshot eyes. His hands are often shaking slightly, either from the previous 
night’s drinking or from the strain of heavy labor.  
- Equipment: A small flask tucked in his belt, hidden from most of the others.  
- Posture: He sways slightly when standing still, but when he moves to work, it’s with surprising agility.

	Personality : Rolf is a man of contradictions: a heavy drinker with a surprisingly sharp mind when it comes to work. Despite his love for ale, he’s still 
dependable when it comes to labor, though his temper flares up when he’s deprived of his nightly drink. He’s often seen grumbling under his breath about everything,
but his work is rarely subpar.

	Behaviour :  
- Rolf can often be found at the tavern or in the workers’ break area, nursing his drink. Despite his apparent laziness, he’s still an essential part of the dock's 
workforce, especially when it comes to lifting heavy items or operating machinery.  
- He’s a man of habit, needing his regular drinks to keep going, but when sober, he’s sharp and focused. His moods swing between foul and cheerful, depending on the
availability of alcohol.
