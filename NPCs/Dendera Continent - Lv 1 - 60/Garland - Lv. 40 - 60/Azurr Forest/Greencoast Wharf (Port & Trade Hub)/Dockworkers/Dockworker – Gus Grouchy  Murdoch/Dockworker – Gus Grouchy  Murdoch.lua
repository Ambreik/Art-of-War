---

	Appearance :  
- Age: Late 40s  
- Attire: A rough, faded tunic that’s seen better days, with patches and repairs. His sleeves are rolled up, revealing muscular arms. He wears a pair of heavy boots that thud when he walks.  
- Distinguishing Features: A thick, greying beard, a permanent scowl on his face, and a few deep lines etched into his forehead from years of hard labor. His eyes are sharp but often narrowed in irritation.  
- Equipment: A heavy wrench or crowbar that he uses to adjust large machinery or move cargo, though he’s known to yell at it when things go wrong.  
- Posture: Gus is typically hunched over in work, but when standing, he’s a towering figure with broad shoulders and a stern, imposing presence.

	Personality : Gus is the quintessential grumpy old dockworker. He’s never satisfied, and he’s never afraid to complain about the work, the weather, or the 
management. But despite his constant complaints, Gus is extremely reliable. He’s the kind of worker you want when things need to be done, even if he’s not the 
easiest person to deal with. He grumbles through every task, but his work is meticulous, and he gets the job done.

	Behaviour :  
- Gus is usually found in the thick of the physical labor at the wharf, grumbling at the crates, machinery, or anything that doesn’t meet his standard. He often 
mutters under his breath about how things used to be better.  
- He’s not one for small talk and is often seen working solo, but he’ll offer advice or help when pushed to it. Despite his sour mood, he has a respect for those 
who can keep up with the demanding work.  
- He won’t tolerate laziness, and those who slack off may find themselves on the receiving end of a harsh verbal lashing.
