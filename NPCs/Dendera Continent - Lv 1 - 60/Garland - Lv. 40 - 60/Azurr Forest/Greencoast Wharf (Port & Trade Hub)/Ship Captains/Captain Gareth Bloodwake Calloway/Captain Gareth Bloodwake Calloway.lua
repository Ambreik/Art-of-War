			Captain Gareth "Bloodwake" Calloway  

	Location : Ship Deck, The *Reaver's Wake* (Docked at Greencoast Wharf)  

	Role : Storyline NPC, Ship Captain, Skillable & Strong in Combat  

	Appearance : Captain Gareth Calloway is a tall, imposing figure, with a weathered face marked by years of salty winds and the scars of past encounters. His 
beard is dark and neatly trimmed, but his eyes—piercing and cold—are the most striking feature. His left arm is adorned with tattoos of anchors and storm waves, 
marking his past as a smuggler and pirate. He wears a long, dark captain's coat, weathered leather boots, and a belt lined with a variety of weapons: a cutlass, 
pistols, and a dagger. The air around him seems to hum with danger, making it clear he’s someone not to be trifled with.

	Personality : Calloway is an enigmatic and dangerous character, infamous in both the underworld and the legitimate world for his smuggling operations. He has a 
magnetic aura of authority and is quick to turn any situation to his advantage. While he may appear cruel and calculating, he is also fiercely protective of those 
he considers loyal, though those in his inner circle are few and far between. His dealings are always wrapped in secrecy, and it’s unclear whether his motivations 
are purely financial or if there’s something more beneath his surface.

	Role & Mechanics :  
- Storyline Involvement : Calloway is deeply involved in major quests relating to smuggling rings, illicit trade routes, and dangerous missions that may involve 
shady alliances. Players may need to confront or collaborate with him during certain story arcs, navigating the moral grey areas of piracy and lawlessness.
- Combat Strength : Captain Calloway is highly skilled in naval combat and personal combat. He is proficient with both ranged (pistols, cannons) and melee (
cutlasses, boarding axes) weapons, and his tactics involve cunning ambushes, both on land and sea. He can also command his crew in battle, using a series of command
abilities during ship battles.

	Abilities & Skills :
- Bloodwake Strike (Melee): A powerful sword strike that deals high damage, leaving a bleeding effect on enemies.
- Pirate’s Call (Command): Boosts the morale of nearby allied NPCs, increasing their damage and defense.
- Cannoneer’s Fury (Ranged): Fires a volley of cannonballs from his ship, causing widespread damage to enemies.
- Smuggler’s Escape (Escape): When engaged in combat or facing danger, Calloway can use his smuggler’s knowledge to evade capture, disappearing into the fog or 
using secret passages.

	Quotes :
- "You think you're the first to try and take me down? I’ve survived worse storms than you’ll ever see."
- "No man’s hands are clean, but the pay’s good on my ship. If you’ve got the nerve, you’ll make a fortune."
- "I’ve got no allegiance but to the coin. And if you’ve got enough of that, I might just consider your offer."
