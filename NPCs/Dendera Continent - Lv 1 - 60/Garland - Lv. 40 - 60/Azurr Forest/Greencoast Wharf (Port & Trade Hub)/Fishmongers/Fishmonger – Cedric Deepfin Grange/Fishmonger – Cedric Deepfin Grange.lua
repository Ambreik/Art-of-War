			Fishmonger – Cedric "Deepfin" Grange  

	Location : Fishmonger Stall, Greencoast Wharf Market Area  

	Role : Flavor NPC, Lorekeeper  

	Appearance : Cedric is a tall, lanky man with deep lines on his face and a perpetually squinting expression, as though he’s constantly peering into the depths 
of the ocean. His clothes are a patchwork of sea-worn garments, and he often sports a long, thick beard. His eyes are a sharp blue, matching the deep ocean he 
claims to have explored.

	Personality : Cedric is the type of person who always has a story to tell, most of which are tall tales involving mysterious sea creatures. He speaks in a slow,
deliberate manner, often getting lost in his own stories. While some dismiss him as a fool, those who listen closely may catch snippets of truth in his words. He’s 
a charming, eccentric old man who’s more at home talking about the sea than actually selling fish.

	Flavor Text / Lore : Cedric's stall is filled with a hodgepodge of fish and fishing equipment, but he spends most of his time talking to anyone who will listen 
about legendary fish he’s heard of—or supposedly caught—over the years. His stories range from the absurd (fish with scales that glow in the dark) to the terrifying
(a giant, deep-sea leviathan that is said to drag entire ships under). He’s a constant source of rumors about hidden treasures beneath the sea, and those who are 
gullible enough might end up looking for mythical fish rather than the ones that are available for purchase.
