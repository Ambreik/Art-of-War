			Fishmonger – Old Bessie Harridan  

	Location : Fishmonger Stall, Greencoast Wharf Market Area  

	Role : Flavor NPC, Lorekeeper  

	Appearance : Old Bessie is a small, wiry woman with a hunched back and thick spectacles perched on her nose. Her hair is long and graying, and she wears a faded
shawl that’s seen better days. Her skin is deeply tanned from years of working near the water, and her hands are nimble despite her age. She constantly smells of 
salt and brine, and her eyes twinkle with a mischievous gleam.

	Personality : Bessie is known for her odd behavior—whispering to fish, muttering incantations, and acting like she’s listening to the sea. Most dismiss her as 
senile, but she claims to have an unusual connection with the sea creatures she sells. She speaks to them as though they are old friends, and some locals believe 
she truly can understand their language. Whether it’s true or not, she has a knack for convincing customers to buy the fish she claims have "special powers."

	Flavor Text / Lore : Bessie’s stall is filled with all manner of strange fish, some of which appear normal, while others have unusual markings or glowing eyes. 
She often claims that these fish have mystical properties and that she can "hear their whispers" from the depths of the ocean. While many laugh it off as nonsense, 
a few strange occurrences around her stall have given rise to rumors about her possible connection to old sea magic. Old Bessie is known for selling fish that have 
unique properties, like enhancing a person’s luck or providing visions of the future.
