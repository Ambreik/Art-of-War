			Fishmonger – Marla "Mudsnapper" Horne  

	Location : Fishmonger Stall, Greencoast Wharf Market Area  

	Role : Merchant, Vendor  

	Appearance : Marla is a sturdy woman with weathered skin from years spent under the sun. Her hair is pulled back into a messy bun, strands of it turning silver
from age. Her hands are calloused and stained with the scent of fish, and she wears an apron that is both practical and worn. Her eyes are sharp, constantly 
scanning the bustling wharf as she haggles with customers.

	Personality : Marla is direct and no-nonsense, much like the fish she sells. She has a deep love for the sea and the creatures that come from it. While she's a 
skilled businesswoman, she doesn’t like the thought of overfishing and is fiercely protective of the local waters. She's straightforward in her dealings, and 
although gruff at times, she is genuinely helpful when asked about different fish species.

- Common Fish (e.g., bass, trout)
- Rare Fish (e.g., silverfin, mackerel)
- Special Seasonal Catches (e.g., shellfish, eels)
