			Trader – Silas "The Hoarder" Dunn  

	Location : Greencoast Wharf, Market Stall  

---

	Appearance : Silas Dunn is a wiry man in his late 40s, dressed in mismatched clothes and a long, faded cloak that hides his somewhat shifty nature. His face is 
gaunt, with dark circles under his eyes, and his hair is unkempt, as if he hasn’t seen a comb in years. His hands are constantly moving—sorting through his wares, 
pulling things from crates, or showing off items to customers. His stall is overflowing with goods, most of them disorganized and stacked haphazardly. If one were 
to look closely, they’d see some very valuable items mixed in with the trash.

---

	Personality : Silas is always scheming, constantly looking for opportunities to buy low and sell high. He’s not necessarily dishonest, but he certainly knows 
how to make a quick profit off of anyone who’s unaware of the value of what they’re selling. He speaks in rapid, almost frantic tones, as if his next deal is always
just around the corner. He’s quick to haggle, and he seems to have an endless supply of goods that he’s willing to offload—often at a steep markup.

	Role :  
- Role(s) : Vendor, Trader  
	Silas specializes in buying low and selling at a higher price. He sells whatever he buys from players, but his stock depends on what players choose to sell to 
him.

	Mechanics :  
- Type : Vendor, Trader  
- Reputation : No specific reputation required to interact with him.  
- Interaction Limitations : Silas only buys goods from players. His stock is random and changes based on what players sell him.  
- PvP : Not flagged for PvP.  
- Respawn Time : N/A, as he operates as a stationary trader.  
- Other Mechanics : His stock is entirely player-driven, meaning that what’s available to buy depends on what players choose to sell him.

	Skills:  
- Skill 1 : Quick Flip  
	- Description : Silas can immediately put any item he purchases up for sale at a higher price. This skill is passive and makes him an attractive target for 
players with goods they don’t need.  
	- Effect : Silas always makes a profit on items he buys, and his prices reflect a markup based on demand and rarity.

- Skill 2 : Bargain Hunter  
	- Description : Silas is skilled at haggling, allowing him to get great deals on items players sell to him.  
	- Effect : Players may not receive the full value for items they sell to him, but it increases his stock turnover, leading to a better selection for future 
interactions.

- Skill 3 : Shady Deal  
	- Description : Silas can occasionally offer a deal that seems too good to be true. These deals are often a mix of high-value items and very low prices, but 
there’s always a catch.  
	- Effect : Silas will offer certain goods for low prices that may come with hidden costs or conditions.

		- Mid-Quest :

experience the flip side of trading—getting caught up in the art of the deal.
