			General Store – Vance "Greedy" Holbrooke  

	Location : Greencoast Wharf, General Store  

---

	Appearance : Vance Holbrooke is a stout man in his mid-50s with a round belly that seems to spill over his waistcoat. His face is constantly flushed from the 
constant heat of the forge and the work in his shop, but his sharp, calculating eyes never miss an opportunity. He wears a simple brown tunic with an apron stained 
by spilled ink and dust from various goods. A few gold coins dangle from his belt as though they're always within arm's reach. He stands behind a cluttered counter,
surrounded by shelves overflowing with basic wares, from mundane tools to common travel items.

---

	Personality : Vance is known for his sharp business acumen and lack of empathy when it comes to charging his customers. He sees every interaction as a potential
deal, always looking to make a profit. Though not openly hostile, his attitude can be gruff, especially when dealing with customers he deems "outsiders." He’s quick
to upcharge, especially if he senses someone is unaware of the true value of the goods. Despite his nickname "Greedy," Vance has a knack for offering just the right
item when you least expect it, making him indispensable to those who need something at the last minute.
