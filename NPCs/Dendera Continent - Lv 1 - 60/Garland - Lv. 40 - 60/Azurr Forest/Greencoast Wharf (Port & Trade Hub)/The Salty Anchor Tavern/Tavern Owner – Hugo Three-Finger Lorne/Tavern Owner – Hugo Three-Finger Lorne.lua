			Tavern Owner – Hugo "Three-Finger" Lorne  

	Location : "Greencoast Wharf" – The Salty Anchor Tavern

---

	Appearance :  
- Age: Mid 50s  
- Attire: Worn leather vest, a simple linen shirt, and trousers that have clearly seen years of hard use. A large apron with a patch covering a missing pocket hangs
around his waist.  
- Distinguishing Features: Hugo’s most notable feature is his hand, or rather, the lack of it. He’s missing two fingers on his right hand, the result of a bad card 
game, and his left hand is often seen gripping a tankard. His face is weathered from years of working at the dock, with a scruffy beard that barely hides a few deep
scars.  
- Equipment: A small knife he uses to open bottles or slice bread.  
- Posture: He moves with a quiet, deliberate energy, taking his time to get things done, but always with an eye on his customers and the tavern.

	Personality : Hugo is tough but fair, with a sharp wit and a no-nonsense attitude. His past with gambling has left him with a bit of bitterness, and he’s not 
quick to trust anyone, especially newcomers. However, those who prove their worth and reliability will find Hugo to be a loyal ally. He’s got a soft spot for those 
who don’t mind a drink and a card game, even if it ends in a little misfortune. Despite his gruff exterior, he runs a tight ship and ensures that his tavern stays 
lively.

he opens up.
