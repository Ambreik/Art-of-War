			Wandering Merchant – Cedric "Two-Coats" Malden  

	Location : Occasionally visits the Red Flue Stable Tavern, setting up shop near the entrance.

	Appearance : Cedric is a wiry man in his early 50s with a thin, sharp face and a long mustache that he twirls absentmindedly. He wears layered, colorful robes, 
giving him his nickname "Two-Coats." His clothes are adorned with trinkets and charms from his travels, and he always carries a satchel filled with oddities. His 
fingers are covered in rings, and his eyes glint with mischief, always looking for the next deal.

	Personality : Cedric is a smooth talker, always trying to convince travelers that his wares are the best in the land. He enjoys haggling and thrives on the 
thrill of a good deal. Despite his sly nature, he is not dishonest—he just knows how to make a sale sound more enticing. He is full of stories about faraway lands 
and lost treasures, often exaggerating to make his goods seem more valuable. He has a keen sense of danger and will quickly pack up his shop if trouble arises.

	Behaviour : Cedric arrives at the tavern at irregular intervals, usually staying for a day or two before moving on. He sets up a small stall outside the tavern 
and calls out to potential customers. He frequently shifts his stock, meaning players never know exactly what he’ll have for sale each visit.
