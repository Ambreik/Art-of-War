			Tavern Owner – Roland "Roughbrew" Whitlock

	Location : Red Flue Stable Tavern, near a river, with sentinels guarding the area.

---

	Appearance : Roland Whitlock is a middle-aged man with a thick, rugged beard and a warm, yet stern expression. His skin is weathered from years of hard work and
sun exposure, giving him an earthy, brownish hue. He’s dressed in a faded, worn tavern keeper's outfit—breeches, an old leather apron, and a stained shirt—along 
with sturdy boots. He carries a weathered tankard that’s nearly always filled with ale. His posture is upright, but there's a laid-back quality to his movements as 
he navigates the tavern.

---

	Personality : Roland has a commanding presence but exudes a deep sense of hospitality. He’s quick to offer a drink, a story, or a friendly word, but he’s always
alert to any trouble in his tavern. He’s a bit of a gruff fellow, with a dry sense of humor and a tendency to speak plainly. Roland is a man of few words, 
preferring action over excessive chatter, but his loyalty to his patrons is unwavering. He occasionally becomes philosophical when speaking about the "hardships of 
life," often involving a drink to match.

---

	Behaviour : Roland is a vigilant and no-nonsense tavern owner, though he doesn’t show his concern openly. He’s always on the lookout for trouble, especially 
considering the various types of travelers that come through his doors. He’s quick to calm a fight or point out when someone’s had too much to drink, and he’s known
for his "special drink," which he gives out randomly once per day.

		- Mid-Quest : "Found that root yet? If you do, you’ll get a taste of something special… I promise it’s worth it."  
		- Completion : "Ah, you’ve done it! I’ve never tasted anything like this. Here, take this, and enjoy a real drink."  
	- Additional Notes : This quest only unlocks after the player has reached a certain point in the main story. The Mystic Root is located in a dangerous zone near
the river and requires a tough fight with some wild creatures.
