			Cook – Mina "The Flame" Walker

	Location : Red Flue Stable Tavern, near the river.

	Appearance : Mina is a middle-aged woman with a tall, athletic build, and a warm yet fiery presence. Her long black hair is usually tied back in a practical bun
to keep it out of her face as she works over the stove. She has a few streaks of flour on her arms and apron, and her dark brown eyes glisten with determination. 
Her skin is tanned from hours spent in front of the flames. Mina wears a chef’s tunic that’s slightly singed from the heat of the kitchen. Her movements are quick 
and precise as she works her magic in the kitchen.

	Personality : Mina is passionate about food and cooking. She can be fiery and quick-tempered when something goes wrong in the kitchen, but she also has a 
nurturing side that shows when she serves food to a hungry customer. She’s proud of her culinary skills and will sometimes challenge the more daring adventurers to 
try new dishes she’s working on. Mina speaks her mind and doesn’t tolerate laziness or incompetence. Beneath her tough exterior, she’s kind-hearted and willing to 
share her knowledge with those who show genuine interest in cooking.

	Behaviour : Mina spends most of her time in the tavern’s kitchen, chopping, stirring, and checking on the dishes. She occasionally emerges to greet guests or 
offer them a taste of her latest creation. She is always on the lookout for fresh ingredients to improve her dishes, often sending players to nearby regions to 
gather herbs or meats.
