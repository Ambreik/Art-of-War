			Adira Pell  

	Location : Azurr Forest / Vygor Port / Customs Office  

---

	Appearance : Adira Pell is a stern-looking woman in her late 30s, with short, dark hair always neatly tied back. Her sharp hazel eyes seem to scan everything with suspicion, and her rigid posture shows her discipline. She wears a dark navy officer’s coat with silver embroidery, signifying her rank as the Customs Officer of Vygor Port. A ledger filled with cargo manifests is always in her hands, and a thin dagger is strapped to her thigh—a subtle warning that she’s not just a bureaucrat.

- Not easily fooled, but will accept bribes if the situation calls for it.  
- Values efficiency over morality, often reminding people: _"Smuggling exists because we allow it to."_
