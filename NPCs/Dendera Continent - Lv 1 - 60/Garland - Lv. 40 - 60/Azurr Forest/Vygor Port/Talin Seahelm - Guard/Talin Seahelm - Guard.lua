---

	Appearance : Talin Seahelm is a tall, broad-shouldered man in his early thirties, with weathered skin from years of exposure to the salty sea breeze. His dark 
hair is cropped short, and his piercing blue eyes scan the surroundings with constant vigilance. His uniform consists of a navy-blue cloak adorned with the emblem 
of the port on the chest, along with reinforced leather armor designed for both comfort and protection. He wears a wide belt, holstered with a sword and a dagger, 
both well-maintained but showing signs of frequent use. His posture is always straight, exuding confidence and readiness to act at any moment.

	Personality : Talin Seahelm has a no-nonsense attitude, always focused on his duties to ensure the safety of the port and its inhabitants. He comes across as 
stern and businesslike, offering only brief responses unless prompted with specific questions. However, beneath his serious demeanor, he has a deep sense of 
responsibility and a dry sense of humor that only surfaces in rare moments of relaxation. While he’s not the type to engage in lengthy conversations, he’s a 
reliable source of information when it comes to the safety and politics of the area.

	Behaviour : Talin constantly patrols the docks, keeping an eye out for troublemakers, smugglers, and any signs of potential threats. He reacts quickly to 
disturbances, and will approach anyone acting suspiciously, asking them for their purpose at the port. While not aggressive by nature, he’s quick to react to 
hostile players and will defend the port and its people if provoked.
