			Magnus Holt

	Location : Azurr Forest / Vygor Port / Dock Inspection Office  

---

	Appearance : A tall, wiry man with sharp features, Magnus Holt stands out with his piercing green eyes and a permanent scowl. His long, black coat is well-
maintained, adorned with a gold-trimmed insignia that marks him as the official Port Inspector. He wears leather gloves at all times and carries a ledger filled 
with reports on every ship passing through Vygor Port. His belt holds a rapier, rarely used but razor-sharp, and he has a habit of tapping it when he’s thinking. 
His skeletal frame makes him seem frail, but his unwavering posture shows he’s anything but weak.
