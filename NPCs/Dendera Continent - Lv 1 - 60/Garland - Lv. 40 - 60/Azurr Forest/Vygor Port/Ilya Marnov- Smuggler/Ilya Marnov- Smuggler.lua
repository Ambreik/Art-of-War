	Appearance : A slender woman with short, dark auburn hair and striking emerald-green eyes that seem to be constantly scanning her surroundings. She wears a 
fitted leather coat with hidden pockets, lightweight dark trousers, and soft boots that barely make a sound when she moves.A silver dagger is strapped to her thigh,
though she rarely needs to use it. A faint smirk plays on her lips as if she knows something you don’t.

	Personality : Ilya is witty, cunning, and always a step ahead of trouble. She treats life like a game, always looking for the next profitable opportunity while 
dodging port authorities. She has a sharp sense of humor, often teasing those who interact with her, and even in serious situations, she never truly loses her cool.
However, she’s no fool—if things turn dangerous, she vanishes before anyone can react.
