			Kara Lorn  

	Location : Azurr Forest / Vygor Port / Hidden Docks & Market Alleys  

---

	Appearance : A striking resemblance to her sister, "Ilya Marnov", but slightly taller and leaner. Kara has long, raven-black hair, usually tied back, and 
piercing blue eyes that miss nothing. She wears a dark cloak with a hood she frequently pulls up when sneaking through the port. Unlike Ilya’s laid-back charm, 
Kara’s expression is sharp and calculating, with a scar running from her jawline to her collarbone, hinting at a past encounter that went wrong. Twin daggers rest 
at her hips, but her real strength lies in deception.  

---

	Personality : Kara is colder, more ruthless, and far less forgiving than Ilya. She trusts no one, preferring efficiency over charm. She doesn’t joke as much, 
but when she does, her humor is dark and biting. While Ilya enjoys the game, Kara plays to win, and she’s willing to cut loose ends if needed. Despite this, she has
an undeniable loyalty to her sister, and they often cover for each other when things go south.
