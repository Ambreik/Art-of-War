			Tara Ironroot

	Location : The Forgotten Altar, Ancient Ruins

---

	Appearance : Tara is a tall, robust woman in her early thirties, with a muscular build that reflects years of outdoor labor. Her attire consists of practical, 
worn leather armor designed for comfort and utility, with pouches for herbs, bones, and small tools. Her long, untamed auburn hair is often tied back into a simple 
braid, with leaves and twigs frequently tangled in it. Her face, weathered by years of work in the wild, holds a stern expression, while her sharp eyes constantly 
scan her surroundings. She carries a large, intricately carved bone knife at her side, often used for practical tasks related to her studies and quests.

	Personality : Tara is blunt, to the point, and not one for idle chatter. Her straightforward nature can sometimes come across as gruff, but she is deeply 
passionate about preserving the natural world and upholding the traditions of her craft. She has little tolerance for laziness or incompetence but will express 
grudging respect for anyone who demonstrates a strong work ethic. Tara is fiercely independent and doesn't seek recognition for her efforts, but she enjoys the 
company of those who share her dedication to the environment. Her actions may come off as harsh at times, but she is driven by a desire to protect the delicate 
balance of nature.

	Behaviour : Tara tends to keep to herself, focusing on her work in the wilds. While she doesn’t typically engage in conversation unless necessary, her behavior 
is often seen as protective and grounded. She moves through the environment with purpose, often hunting for rare plants or animal remains. Tara is a woman of few 
words but will give orders or instructions when needed. When interacting with other NPCs or players, she might be seen gruffly offering advice on finding rare 
plants or animal bones, but she is usually more action-oriented than talkative.
