			Arielle "Watersong"

	Location : Azurr Forest, near rivers and streams

---

	Appearance : Arielle "Watersong" appears as a translucent, ghostly figure with a soft blue glow, her form flowing gracefully like water. Her long, flowing hair 
and ethereal dress appear to be made of shimmering mist and water, constantly shifting with the current of the river. Her face is serene, with delicate features 
that convey both wisdom and kindness. In the dim light, she appears almost like a living reflection of the river, with her form appearing to ripple and fade in the 
wind, like a water surface disturbed by a gentle breeze. Her presence emits a soothing, calming aura, and the air around her feels fresh and cool.

	Personality : Arielle is a calm, serene, and wise spirit of the river. She speaks with a soft and melodic voice, her words full of grace and peace. She is 
benevolent, offering blessings to those who show respect and care for nature, but her trust is not easily won. She has an air of mystery, and while she appears warm
and welcoming, she can disappear in an instant if she senses harm or disrespect.

	Role :  
- Role(s) : Spirit, Blessing Giver, Debuff Giver  
	Arielle is a benevolent river spirit who grants blessings to those who approach her with respect. She offers buffs related to swimming and river-related 
activities, and in rare cases, players may receive a rare fish. However, if a player attacks or disrespects her, she vanishes permanently for that player.

	Mechanics :  
- Type : Spirit NPC (Blessing/Debuff Giver)  
- Reputation : Not tied to any faction; offers a one-time blessing to all players who approach respectfully.  
- Interaction Limitations : Players must approach the river spirit without causing harm or disturbance to the environment. If the player attacks her or shows disrespect (e.g., damaging the river or disturbing wildlife), Arielle will vanish permanently for that player.  
- PvP : Arielle is not flagged for PvP. She is invulnerable to player attacks, but players who attack her will suffer consequences.  
- Respawn Time : If a player harms or disrespects Arielle, she vanishes permanently for that individual, with no respawn for them. Other players can interact with her, provided they have not attacked her.  
- Other Mechanics :  
	- Blessing or Debuff System : When players interact with Arielle, they have a chance to receive one of several blessings or, rarely, a debuff. Players can only receive one blessing per day, preventing repeated abuse.  
	- Blessings :  
		- Faster Swimming Speed : Increases swimming speed by 50% for 1 hour.  
		- Rare Fish : Arielle may gift a rare, enchanted fish that can be sold to specific NPCs for a high price or used for crafting special items.  
		- Water Breath : Grants the ability to breathe underwater for 30 minutes.  
		- Healing Waters : Heals the player for 10% of their maximum health when they are near water for 10 minutes.  
		- Serenity of the Waters : Reduces stress or debuffs by 30% and increases resistance to mind control effects for 1 hour.  
	- Debuffs (Rare and Unlucky Occurrence):  
		- Tidal Curse : Slows the player by 20% for 30 minutes.  
		- Drowned Echo : Causes the player to have a disorienting effect, reducing accuracy by 15% for 10 minutes.  
		- Drifting Fog : Reduces visibility around the player by 50% for 30 minutes, making navigation harder.  
		- Rip Current : Reduces stamina regeneration by 25% for 15 minutes.
