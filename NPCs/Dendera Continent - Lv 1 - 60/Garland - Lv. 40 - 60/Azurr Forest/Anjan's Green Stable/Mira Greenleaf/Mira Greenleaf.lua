	Appearance : Mira is a petite woman with long, flowing auburn hair that she often ties back with a simple leather cord. Her face is freckled and often flushed 
from the outdoor work she does, tending to plants and herbs. She wears practical, earth-toned clothing—a loose green tunic and a brown belt that holds various 
pouches and jars. Around her neck, she wears a necklace made of dried flowers, a symbol of her connection to nature. She carries a basket filled with freshly picked
herbs, and her hands are stained with plant sap, showing the care she takes in her craft.

	Personality : Mira is warm and nurturing, with a deep passion for the natural world. She speaks in a soft, melodic voice and is always eager to share her 
knowledge of herbs, plants, and their uses. She is kind-hearted and patient, always willing to listen to those who need advice on healing or remedies. However, she 
can become fiercely protective when it comes to the plants she cultivates, especially rare herbs that require careful attention. She enjoys helping adventurers with
potions and remedies, though she prefers working with those who respect nature and its resources.

	Behaviour : Mira can often be seen tending to the plants near the stable, carefully harvesting herbs or preparing mixtures for potions. When approached by
players, she will smile warmly and offer them advice on healing or remedies for ailments. If a player expresses interest in herbalism, she will be more than happy 
to teach them a thing or two, though she is strict about who she shares her knowledge with. Mira is also known for her quiet moments spent sitting under a nearby 
tree, meditating or writing in a small journal.
