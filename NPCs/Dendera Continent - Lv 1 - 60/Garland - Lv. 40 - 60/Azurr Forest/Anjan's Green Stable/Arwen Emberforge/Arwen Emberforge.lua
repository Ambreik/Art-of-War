			Arwen Emberforge

	Location : Anjan's Green Stable (Stable & Blacksmith Area)

---

	Appearance : Arwen Emberforge is a tall and imposing woman with broad shoulders and an athletic build, a result of years spent hammering metal and working with 
heavy tools. Her hair is dark red, pulled back into a practical ponytail, and her skin has a slightly sun-kissed hue from working outdoors. Her face bears a few 
scorch marks and faint scars from her work at the forge, but her smile remains warm and welcoming. She wears a leather apron over a simple shirt and pants, with a 
belt full of tools and a heavy hammer slung at her side. Her eyes are a bright amber, glowing with the fire of her craft.

	Personality : Arwen is direct, confident, and passionate about her work. She speaks with authority but never dismissively—she respects those who understand the 
value of hard work and craftsmanship. She enjoys talking shop and can be a bit of a perfectionist, always striving to create the best quality items possible. While 
she may come off as tough, she has a soft spot for adventurers and will always lend a hand if they’re in need of repairs or enhancements to their gear.

	Behaviour : Arwen spends most of her time at the forge, shaping and molding metal into weapons, armor, and tools for both the stable and adventurers passing 
through. She is methodical and precise in her work, often muttering to herself about the balance of steel or the heat of the fire. When players approach, she stands
tall and strong, ready to offer her services, but if they stay too long, she’ll become focused on her next task and may not notice them until spoken to.
