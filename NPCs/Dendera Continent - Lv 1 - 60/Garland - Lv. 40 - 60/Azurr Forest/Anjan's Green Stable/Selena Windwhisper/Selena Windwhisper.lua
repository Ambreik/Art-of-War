braid adorned with feathers. Her sharp, pale blue eyes are full of curiosity and keen focus, constantly analyzing the materials she works with. She wears a simple 
yet refined outfit made of soft leather, with a pouch filled with fletching tools hanging from her belt. Her gloves, though worn, are designed for precision and
