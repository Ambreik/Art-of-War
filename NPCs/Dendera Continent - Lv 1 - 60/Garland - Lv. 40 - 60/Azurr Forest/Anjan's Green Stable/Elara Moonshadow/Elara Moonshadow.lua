			Elara Moonshadow

	Location : Shadow’s Rest, Nightshade Alley, Capital City

---

	Appearance : Elara is a slender, graceful woman in her early thirties, with a mysterious and almost ethereal presence. Her dark, midnight-blue hooded cloak 
blends seamlessly with the shadows, and her black leather armor is sleek and lightweight, designed for stealth. She wears an assortment of throwing knives and small
daggers strapped to her thighs and waist. Her pale, almost translucent skin is marked with intricate tattoos, swirling patterns of black ink that seem to move when 
observed in the corner of one's eye. Her eyes are an intense shade of violet, always alert and calculating. Her long, raven-black hair is usually tied back in a 
loose, practical braid.

---

	Personality : Elara is quiet, calculating, and always observant. She speaks only when necessary, her words precise and often laced with subtle humor or sharp 
wit. Though she carries herself with a sense of calm confidence, her eyes betray an ever-watchful mind, always assessing her surroundings. She is fiercely 
independent and dislikes unnecessary interaction, preferring to observe from the shadows rather than engaging directly unless absolutely necessary. Elara is a 
master of keeping secrets, and while she isn’t openly kind, she does show an underlying respect for those who understand the ways of stealth and subterfuge.

---

	Behaviour : Elara is often seen lounging in the shadows of her small hideout, a place known only to a few trusted individuals. She avoids unnecessary attention 
but occasionally steps into the streets of Capital City, where she’s known to disappear into the dark corners of alleys or rooftops with the grace of a shadow. When
approached, she doesn’t immediately engage in conversation but will offer a subtle nod, acknowledging the player’s presence. She is constantly testing her 
surroundings, assessing threats, and ensuring her own safety. Her interactions are brief, and she expects those who seek her training to show a level of skill and 
seriousness.

	Role :  
- Role(s) : Trainer, Quest Giver  
	Elara is a mentor to those who wish to learn the art of stealth, lockpicking, and other rogue-related skills. She offers guidance in the ways of the rogue and 
provides various quests to test a player's skill and cunning. She can also provide specialized training in techniques like backstabbing, evasion, and disarming 
traps.

	Mechanics :  
- Type : Trainer, Quest Giver  
- Reputation : None, but players who perform tasks for Elara or prove their stealth skills will gain her respect, allowing for more challenging training and access 
to special quests.  
- Interaction Limitations : Players must be at least level 15 to begin training with Elara. Only those who have a rogue, assassin, or related class can access her training sessions and quests.  
- PvP : Elara is not flagged for PvP and cannot be attacked by players. She will, however, disallow any disruptive behavior in her presence, such as threatening or attempting to rob her.  
- Respawn Time : Elara has no respawn timer, as she remains in the same location unless involved in a quest event.  
- Other Mechanics : Elara provides the player with special stealth-based tools (e.g.,smoke bombs, poison darts) and unique crafting recipes for rogue-related items.
She can also provide hidden quests related to shadowy tasks or clandestine missions that require a high degree of stealth and cunning.

	Quest :  
- Quest Title : The Silent Blade  
	- Quest Type : Storyline/Side Quest  
	- Objective(s) :  
		- Steal a sealed letter from the City Guard’s strongbox without alerting any guards.  
		- Deliver the letter to Elara’s contact in the undercity.  
		- Report back to Elara once the task is complete.  
	- Rewards :  
		- Experience points  
		- Rogue-themed item (e.g., enchanted dagger or poison kit)  
		- Access to advanced training techniques  
	- Conditions : Level 15 or higher, must have completed the introductory quest “The Rogue’s Path.”  
	- Quest Dialogue :  
		- Opening : “You think you’re ready to learn the art of the rogue? Good. But first, you’ll need to prove your skill. Steal a letter from the City Guard and 
	bring it to me. No one must know you were there. Are you up for it?”  
		- Mid-Quest : “You’ve done well so far, but be careful. The shadows won’t always be kind to those who aren’t prepared. Finish this without a trace, and I’ll
	consider training you further.”  
		- Completion : “You’ve done well. The letter is in safe hands, and I now know you have what it takes. Come back when you’re ready for more… and I’ll teach 
	you things that others can only dream of.”  
	- Additional Notes : The quest will only be available after completing “The Rogue’s Path,” a quest that introduces the player to the rogue class and its basic
mechanics. The stealth required in this quest is significant, and failing to remain undetected will cause Elara to lose trust in the player.
