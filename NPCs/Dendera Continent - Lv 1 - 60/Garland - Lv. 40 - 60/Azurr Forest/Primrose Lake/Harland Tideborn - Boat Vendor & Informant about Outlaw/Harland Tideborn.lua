			Harland Tideborn

	Location : Lakeside Dock, Outland Territories (Shoreline Village)

---

	Appearance : Harland Tideborn is a middle-aged man with a weathered but friendly face, a salt-and-pepper beard that reaches his chest, and a broad grin that 
makes him approachable. His skin is tanned from years spent working under the sun, and his hair is a mess of tangled dark waves, often tied back with a simple #
leather cord. He wears a loose-fitting sailor's outfit, complete with a light blue shirt, brown trousers, and a sturdy pair of boots, perfect for life on the 
water. His most distinctive feature is a collection of small seashells and fishbone charms woven into a necklace, each one representing a different journey or 
destination. He carries a weather-beaten satchel filled with maps and supplies for his boats, and his posture suggests he's used to long days at sea.

	Personality : Harland is warm, talkative, and full of stories about the lakes, the boats, and the far-off places he’s visited. His demeanor is easygoing, often 
joking with those who stop by his dock. While he's generally approachable, his eyes reveal a deep understanding of the tides and the waters he's so familiar with. 
He’s more than just a merchant—he’s a storyteller, and his tales are often full of strange encounters and places only a seasoned boatman would know. Harland is 
patient with travelers and is always willing to share his wisdom about boating, offering advice to anyone who needs it. He has a great love for the lakes and those 
who rely on the water, but he can be serious when talking about the dangers the waters hide, especially the outlaws who sometimes lurk in the area.

	Behaviour : Harland is almost always found at his boat stall by the lakeside, either cleaning a fishing vessel, repairing a rowboat, or chatting with customers.
When players approach, he’ll greet them warmly, often offering advice or cracking a joke. If the weather is calm, he might be seen polishing his boats or arranging 
them in neat rows for travelers to choose from. If there’s a storm brewing or tension in the air, Harland’s mood shifts to a more cautious one, always keeping an 
eye on the horizon. He occasionally checks his maps and mutters about the movement of the tides and the rumors he’s heard about outlaws in the area.
