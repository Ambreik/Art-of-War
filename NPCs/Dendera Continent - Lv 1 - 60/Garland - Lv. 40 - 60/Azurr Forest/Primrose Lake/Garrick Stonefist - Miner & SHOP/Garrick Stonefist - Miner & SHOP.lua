	Appearance : Garrick Stonefist is a broad-shouldered, stocky man with a face weathered by years of hard labor underground. His hands are large and rough, his 
knuckles scarred from constant work with heavy tools. His hair is dark and thick, falling in a somewhat unruly manner, and he sports a thick beard flecked with bits
of dirt and ash. His clothing consists of a sturdy leather vest, reinforced with iron plates, and trousers worn from constant movement in the mines. He always 
carries a pickaxe slung over his shoulder, a tool he treats like an extension of himself.

	Personality : Garrick is a no-nonsense type of man, blunt and focused on the task at hand. He doesn't appreciate frivolous conversation or distractions, 
especially from people like Mira Brook, whose antics he finds irritating. Despite his gruff demeanor, Garrick has a strong sense of duty and a soft spot for those 
who show dedication to their work. He values efficiency and results, always preferring hard work over idle chatter.

	Behaviour : Garrick can typically be found at his shop, either working on repairing tools or tending to his stock of mining equipment. He’s often seen muttering
under his breath, especially when Mira is near, and he’s quick to return to his work if interrupted. When approached, he’ll give a brief greeting before offering a 
gruff summary of what he has to offer.
