with seaweed or driftwood, giving him a somewhat untamed look. He wears simple, practical clothing suited for life on the lake—worn leather boots, faded trousers, 
and a vest made from fish hide. His eyes are an unusual shade of pale blue, often fixed on the lake with a quiet intensity. A collection of small trinkets and 
charms made from shells, feathers, and scales adorns his neck and wrists. His hands are calloused, evidence of years of working with the creatures he tames.

enjoys his solitude, he’s always willing to share a story or give advice about his beloved aquatic and semi-aquatic creatures. Despite his sometimes cryptic 
demeanor, Osric is a caring individual, and his devotion to animal welfare is evident in everything he does.

	Behaviour : Osric can usually be found by the lake, tending to his collection of rare and exotic creatures,which can be seen swimming or lounging near his tent.
He’s often seen whispering or humming softly as he interacts with them. If approached by a player, he’ll offer them a warm smile and engage in a conversation about 
the animals in his care. When players ask about his pets, Osric’s demeanor becomes even more animated, and he eagerly shares details about the creatures. He is also
quite meticulous about the care of any animals that players leave in his care.
