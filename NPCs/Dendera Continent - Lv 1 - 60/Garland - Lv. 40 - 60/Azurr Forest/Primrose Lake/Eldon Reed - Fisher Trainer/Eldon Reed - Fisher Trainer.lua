			Eldon Reed

	Location: Primrose Lake (Fishing & Trade Spot)

---

	Appearance: Eldon Reed is an older man in his late 50s, with sun-kissed skin from years spent fishing under the open sky. His weathered face is framed by a 
neatly trimmed beard, streaked with grey. He wears a simple fisherman's tunic, faded from constant use, and a wide-brimmed hat to shield his eyes from the sun. A 
sturdy wooden fishing rod is always by his side, and his hands are rough from handling fishing lines and lures. His posture is relaxed but confident, as if at home 
in the waters of Primrose Lake.

---

	Personality: Eldon is a calm, patient individual, with a deep passion for fishing. He has a wealth of knowledge and enjoys sharing it with others, though he can
be a bit gruff when he's focused on his craft. His love for fishing and the lake runs deep, and he has a soft spot for those who show genuine interest in learning 
the art. Despite his serious nature, Eldon occasionally cracks a smile or tells a joke, especially when the "Fish Mania Event" is in full swing. 

---

	Behaviour: Eldon can be seen often fishing at the dock during the day and sometimes late into the night. On rare occasions, he’ll be seen crafting lures when 
he’s not engaging with players. At night, if he's not fishing, he can be found sleeping near the dock, with his fishing rod still resting beside him.
