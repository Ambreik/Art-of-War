			Mira Brook

	Location : Primrose Lake (Forest Area near the lake)

---

	Appearance : Mira is a young woman in her early 20s, with long, chestnut-brown hair often tied into a loose braid that drapes over her shoulder. Her bright 
green eyes reflect her adventurous spirit, and her skin is sun-kissed from spending hours outdoors. She wears a simple, practical outfit—a green tunic, leather 
boots, and a small satchel slung over her shoulder, filled with gathered herbs and berries. A small, wooden staff is her trusted companion, useful for walking the 
forest paths. Mira’s overall appearance gives off an air of curiosity and a deep connection to nature.

	Personality : Mira is an energetic, free-spirited individual with a love for nature and a curiosity that leads her into occasional trouble. She’s optimistic, 
often seen with a smile on her face, and loves to explore the wilderness around Primrose Lake. She’s very kind-hearted but sometimes gets a little too adventurous, 
which can lead to her getting lost or tangled in a situation. Mira enjoys chatting with others and is known for her tales of the odd plants or animals she’s 
encountered.

	Behaviour : Mira spends most of her time gathering herbs, berries, and other natural resources from the forest near Primrose Lake. She’s frequently seen walking
through the woods with her satchel, chatting happily to herself or humming a tune. However, if a specific event occurs (like a rare plant blooming), she might 
disappear for a while, prompting concerns among those around her. When players interact with her, she’s always friendly, but occasionally she might slip off into 
the woods without warning, prompting a search.

		- Mid-Quest : "I knew this was going to happen… please hurry, I’m not sure where I am anymore."  
		- Completion : "Oh, thank goodness! I was starting to think I was stuck here forever. I’ll owe you one! Here, take these herbs as a token of my thanks."  
	- Additional Notes : This quest can be repeated once a day, as Mira often goes on solo excursions to find new plants, which can trigger her being lost in the 
woods again.
