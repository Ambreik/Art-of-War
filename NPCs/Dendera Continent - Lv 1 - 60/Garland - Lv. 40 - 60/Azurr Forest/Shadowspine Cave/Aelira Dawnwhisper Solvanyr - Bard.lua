			Aelira "Dawnwhisper" Solvanyr

	Location : Shadowspine Cave, Echoing Caves of Shadowspine  

---

	Appearance : Aelira "Dawnwhisper" Solvanyr is an ethereal and slightly otherworldly figure. Her long, flowing silver hair seems to shimmer in the dim light of
the cave, and her deep, sea-green eyes seem to see beyond the physical realm. She wears robes of muted blues and silvers that blend with the cave’s natural 
environment, embroidered with ancient patterns that hint at a lost language. Around her neck hangs an amulet shaped like a musical note, its soft glow pulsing in 
rhythm with the cave’s sounds. Her movements are graceful, almost fluid, as though she is part of the very air that echoes through the caves.

---

	Personality : Aelira is a quiet, reserved, and enigmatic individual who speaks in riddles and cryptic phrases. Her speech is slow and deliberate, each word 
hanging in the air as if it carries weight beyond mere language. Though she can be kind and helpful, her wisdom comes with a price: she demands respect for the 
ancient knowledge she holds. She rarely reveals her true intentions and prefers to leave adventurers to their own devices, guiding them only when necessary. She 
sees the Echoing Caves as a living, breathing entity, and her connection to the caves runs deeper than most would suspect.

---

	Behaviour : Aelira has a calm and collected demeanor. She will only speak to players who have proven their worth by solving a puzzle within the caves or 
completing a task she sets for them. Upon first interaction, she seems to ignore the player, humming to herself as though lost in thought. If a player proves they 
are worthy, she will offer them a chance to learn the song that unlocks the hidden chamber. Aelira’s tone shifts from aloof to warm when she speaks of the caves, 
revealing a deep affection for its ancient mysteries.

	Role :  
- Role(s) : Melody Teacher, Quest Giver, Lore Keeper  
	Aelira teaches players a special song that opens the entrance to a hidden chamber deep within the Echoing Caves of Shadowspine. This song is necessary to unlock
a mysterious tome inside the cave that grants players temporary night vision to navigate dark, foreboding areas. She is also a lore keeper of the caves, holding 
ancient knowledge that may aid players in solving puzzles or understanding the history of the area.

	Mechanics :  
- Type : Quest Giver, Song Teacher  
- Reputation : None  
- Interaction Limitations : Players must solve a puzzle within the Echoing Caves or complete a task she assigns (e.g., recovering a lost artifact or retrieving an ancient scroll) before they can learn the song. Players must also be at least level 15 to interact with her.  
- PvP : Aelira is not flagged for PvP, and she cannot be attacked. She will vanish if a player attempts to harm her, returning after a brief cooldown.  
- Respawn Time : Aelira respawns after 1 hour if killed, but this is an event-driven respawn rather than a typical spawn cycle.  
- Other Mechanics :
	- Melody Mechanics : Aelira teaches the player a special melody that is learned by the player’s character. The melody must be played correctly to unlock the 
hidden chamber within the cave. This is done through a mini-game where players must hit specific notes in the correct order, similar to rhythm-based mechanics in 
other games. The notes are hidden in various parts of the cave, and players must explore and piece together the melody through clues found in the environment or 
from solving puzzles. 
	- Tuning the Melody : Players will be able to "tune" the melody over time, increasing its effectiveness. The more times the song is used, the better the night 
vision effect becomes, eventually allowing players to see hidden symbols and passages within dark areas.

	Skills:  
- Skill 1 : Song of the Forgotten Echo  
	- Description : The melody that Aelira teaches unlocks hidden chambers within the Echoing Caves of Shadowspine. Players must play the melody in a specific
sequence to access the hidden chamber where the night vision tome is kept.  
	- Effect : Once the melody is played correctly, the entrance to the hidden chamber opens, revealing the tome that grants temporary night vision. If the melody 
is played incorrectly, players must start again, as the entrance will temporarily close.  
   
- Skill 2 : Echo of Shadows  
	- Description : Aelira imbues her song with the power to enhance the player’s sight. Each time the song is played, it grants night vision that lasts for a 
limited time, allowing players to see through dark areas and uncover hidden objects. The more the player uses the song, the longer the night vision lasts.  
	- Effect : Grants temporary night vision to the player (lasting 2 minutes initially, increasing with each use). Hidden traps, symbols, and secret paths become 
visible.

- Skill 3 : Whispers of the Cave  
	- Description : As the player learns more about the caves and its history, Aelira’s melody can reveal whispers of the past, allowing players to hear the voices 
of those who once roamed the Echoing Caves.  
	- Effect : Grants players brief glimpses into the past, offering clues for puzzles or hidden items within the caves.
