sets. The kernels of the wheat are radiant, with a slightly iridescent hue, making it highly noticeable even in a field of other crops. The wheat has a faint aura

often hidden within the more typical crops, requiring careful searching.

		Lore and Significance :  
	The "Golden Wheat" is a symbol of prosperity and renewal in the Outland Territories. It has been cultivated for generations, with its origins tracing back to 
ancient legends where it was said to have been a gift from the "Earth Spirits" to the people of the region. According to Gryveer Tall, the wheat's magical 
properties make it a key component in enhancing harvests and ensuring good fortune for the upcoming year. Each "Harvest Festival", players must gather the Golden 
Wheat to honor the tradition and to help ensure that future crops will be bountiful.

	Mechanics :  
- Harvesting Golden Wheat :  
	Players can find patches of "Golden Wheat" during the "Harvest Festival" event. They must interact with the patches to "harvest the wheat", which is a special, 
one-time action available during the event. The wheat itself will not regrow after being harvested, making it a limited-time resource.  
	Players must be careful of wild predators or environmental hazards that may be attracted to the wheat during its growth cycle, adding a layer of challenge to 
gathering it.

- Benefits of Golden Wheat :  
	- Crafting Material : The "Golden Wheat" can be used in crafting Festival-exclusive recipes, such as special breads, potions, or farming tools. These crafted 
items grant buffs to players, improving their farming yields or providing temporary boosts to strength, agility, or luck.  
	- Currency : The wheat can also be sold for "Harvest Tokens" (the currency used during the festival), which can then be used to purchase exclusive festival 
items or equipment.  
	- Lore Item : Players who collect enough "Golden Wheat" can use it to unlock specific Festival Lore related to the "Golden Wheat's" origins and its magical 
properties. This lore may offer insight into new farming techniques or provide quests for advanced players looking to explore deeper connections with the land.  
	- Blessing of the Wheat : If a player collects a certain amount of "Golden Wheat" and presents it to "Gryveer Tall", they will receive the "Blessing of the Wheat", a temporary buff that increases farming productivity, reduces crafting times, or grants a special interaction with certain NPCs during the event.

- Magical Properties : The "Golden Wheat" has latent mystical properties tied to the "Earth Spirits". When used in crafting or consumed, it can grant the user 
special abilities or buffs. These include:  
	- Nature’s Bounty : Increases the player’s farming yield for the next 24 hours.  
	- Harvest Strength : Boosts attack power or health regeneration in combat for 1 hour.  
	- Fertile Fields : When planted, this wheat increases the chance of rare crops or magical items appearing in a player’s farm for a limited time.
