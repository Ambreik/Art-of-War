			Brenna Windfoot

	Location : Gryveer Field, Animal Caretaker's Cottage

	Appearance : Brenna Windfoot is a middle-aged woman with long, sandy blonde hair that is often tied back in a simple braid. Her skin is lightly tanned from 
hours spent outdoors caring for animals. She wears a worn but sturdy outfit—a brown tunic, leather boots, and a belt adorned with small pouches for herbs and tools.
Her most distinguishing feature is her gentle, compassionate expression, which softens the weathered lines on her face. A leather satchel filled with animal care 
supplies rests at her side, and she is usually seen carrying a small bag of grain or hay for feeding the animals around her.

	Personality : Brenna is warm-hearted and approachable, with a natural affinity for animals. She exudes a calm, soothing energy that puts even the most skittish 
creatures at ease. She speaks in a gentle, nurturing tone, always willing to help those in need, whether they are fellow villagers or injured animals. She has a 
deep love for the land and its creatures, and her strong sense of responsibility for the animals she cares for is evident in her actions. However, she can become 
stern and determined when dealing with tasks related to animal welfare, showing a tenacious streak when it comes to ensuring their safety and well-being.
