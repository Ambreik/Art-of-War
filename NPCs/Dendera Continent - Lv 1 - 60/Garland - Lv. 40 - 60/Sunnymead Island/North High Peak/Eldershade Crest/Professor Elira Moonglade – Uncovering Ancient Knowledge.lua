	1. Lunar Ritual Mechanic – Moonlit Chambers and the Forgotten Rituals

	Overview : Professor Moonglade's research has revealed that the Eldershade Crest ruins are tied to an ancient lunar cycle. Certain hidden chambers, sealed by 
forgotten rituals, can only be accessed when the moon aligns in specific phases. Players will need to observe the moon's phases and interact with moonlit statues 
or areas at the right time to unlock these secrets.

	Key Features :  
- Lunar Phases : The moon in the game will follow a dynamic cycle with phases that include New Moon, Waxing Crescent, Full Moon, Waning Crescent, etc. Each phase 
will trigger specific effects within the ruins.
- Moonlit Statues : Statues of Elemental Guardians are spread throughout the ruins. When the moonlight hits these statues during the correct phase, they will reveal
hidden paths or chambers. Players can use Lunar Orbs (items obtained through gameplay) to activate the statues.
- Hidden Chambers : Once a player activates a statue during the correct lunar phase, a secret chamber will open, revealing rare artifacts, powerful enemies, and 
lore-heavy items that provide more insight into the Heart of Eldershade and the Elder Civilization.
- Lunar Rituals : These rituals must be completed at specific points in the ruins, requiring players to align different components of the ritual, such as relics, 
stones, or ceremonial markings, to trigger the unlocking of the chamber.

	Rewards :  
- Access to secret dungeons with advanced lore and rewards like Elder Artifacts (powerful relics), Elemental Spirit Stones, and Lunar Energy Crystals (used for 
crafting or enhancing abilities).

abilities.

	Overview : The Heart of Eldershade is a mysterious and dangerous artifact at the center of the Elder Civilization's downfall. It is hidden deep within the 
ruins, protected by dangerous forces and puzzles. Professor Moonglade believes that the artifact could hold immense power, but it also carries great risk.

	Key Features :

challenges associated with each of the Elemental Guardians. Players must defeat Elemental Beasts or complete magical puzzles associated with the elements.

they must solve a final lunar-based puzzle to align the stars and activate the Heart. This will trigger a dangerous event where players must battle the Elemental 
Guardians, who may awaken to protect the artifact.

	Rewards :
