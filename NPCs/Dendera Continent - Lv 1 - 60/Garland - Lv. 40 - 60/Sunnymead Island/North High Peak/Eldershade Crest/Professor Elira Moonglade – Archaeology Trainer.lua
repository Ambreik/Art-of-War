			Professor Elira Moonglade – Uncovering Ancient Knowledge

	Location : Eldershade Crest, Eastern Peak, Ruins of Eldershade

---

	Appearance : Professor Elira Moonglade is a woman in her late 40s, with sharp, emerald eyes that gleam with intelligence and curiosity. Her silver hair is 
pulled back into a loose braid, partially undone from days spent combing through ancient ruins. She wears a practical scholar's robe, stained from her time in the 
field but adorned with trinkets from her travels—small charms, beads, and worn leather straps holding various tools for deciphering ancient texts. Her demeanor is 
scholarly but intense, and her posture is that of someone always on alert, as though awaiting the next great discovery. 

---

	Personality : Elira is highly intelligent, meticulous, and driven by an insatiable curiosity. Her demeanor towards players is one of quiet reverence mixed with 
a sense of excitement for the unknown. She’s formal and somewhat reserved when first meeting strangers but becomes passionate and animated when discussing the 
history of the "Elder Civilization" or any new findings. She has a calm but enthusiastic way of speaking, often speaking quickly as she conveys her excitement 
about the intricacies of the ruins. She is not easily distracted but does appreciate inquisitive minds and welcomes players who share her curiosity.

---

	Behaviour : Professor Moonglade spends most of her time near the "Moonlit Statues" in the heart of the ruins, examining them under different moon phases. She 
reacts to the rise of the moon, and her behavior changes accordingly, becoming more animated when the moonlight activates the statues. If a player is near when this
occurs, she will eagerly explain the significance of the event, offering hints and lore about the "Heart of Eldershade" and other hidden paths.
