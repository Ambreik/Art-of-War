			Aldric "The Sprout"

	Location : Horizon Hearth Tavern, North High Peak, Sunnymead Island

---

	Appearance : Aldric is a young boy, around 17 years old, with messy brown hair and bright green eyes full of excitement and energy. He wears a simple tavern 
apron over a loose-fitting shirt and pants, both a bit too large for his small frame. His cheeks are often flushed with a healthy glow, and a wide smile never 
leaves his face unless he’s nervous. A small scar runs across his left hand, a remnant from when he accidentally spilled a bottle of rum as a child. He’s always 
moving, constantly running back and forth between the counter and tables with his hands full of mugs and bottles.

---

	Personality : Aldric is bubbly, optimistic, and loves interacting with everyone who visits the tavern. He’s friendly to all but especially enjoys meeting new 
people and hearing their stories. Although he’s eager to please and quick with a drink, he tends to get flustered easily, especially when talking to female NPCs. 
Despite his occasional nervousness, his bright attitude and willingness to help out make him a charming, endearing presence in the tavern.

	Behaviour :
- Shy around female NPCs : If a female NPC approaches him, Aldric becomes noticeably embarrassed, often stammering and avoiding eye contact. On some occasions, he 
may even forget to charge for drinks, as his focus shifts toward trying not to make a fool of himself. 
- Frequent interaction with regulars : Aldric is a chatterbox with regulars and will greet players warmly, often asking how their day has been or offering tips for 
navigating the mountain. He takes pride in being a friendly face for returning customers and is quick to start a conversation, especially when the tavern is slow.
- Eager to learn : Although he doesn’t provide quests, Aldric is often seen cleaning the counter or tidying up behind the bar. He watches the other staff closely, 
eager to learn more about bartending and the ways of the tavern.

	- "Hey, hey! It’s you again! How’s the climb going? Got any cool stories to share today? Drinks on the house if you do!"  
- When a female NPC enters and speaks to him :  
	- *Nervously* "Oh! H-hello, ma’am... How, uh... How can I help you? Anything to drink? I’m happy to serve..."  
- When forgetting to charge a female NPC :  
	- "Oh... wait, you didn’t... um, you didn’t pay, did you? I... I’ll just... never mind... I guess you can have it for free. Just... please don’t tell Aldrin, okay?"  
- If a male NPC enters :  
	- "Ah! Hey there, friend! What’ll it be today? I’ve got the finest mead in town, just made it this morning!"

- When Aldric feels confident (perhaps after a successful drink order) :  
	- "Yeah! I’ve got this! I’m a bartender, look at me go!"  
- If Aldric is trying to impress someone (often female NPCs) :  
	- *Shy giggle* "I, uh... I can pour a mean drink, you know... and I’m really good with... uh... mugs and stuff, yeah..."  
- When it’s a slow night :  
	- "It’s a bit quiet tonight... maybe everyone’s already at the Peaks, huh? That’s okay... I’ll keep the drinks flowing until they come back."
