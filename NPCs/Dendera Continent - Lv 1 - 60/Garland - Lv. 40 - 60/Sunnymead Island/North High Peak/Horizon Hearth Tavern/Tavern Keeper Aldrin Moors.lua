			Tavern Keeper Aldrin Moors

	Location : Horizon Hearth Tavern, North High Peak

---

	Appearance : Aldrin Moors is a middle-aged man with a rugged yet welcoming presence. His short, graying hair and neatly trimmed beard give him a distinguished 
air, though the lines around his eyes speak of years spent facing the harsh mountain winds. He wears a simple brown tunic and leather apron, worn but well-kept, 
reflecting his practical nature. A faint aroma of herbs and spices clings to his clothing. Behind the counter, he stands tall, with a sturdy posture, always keeping
an eye on the tavern’s door. His sharp green eyes sparkle with a mix of wit and caution, always sizing up who enters.

---

	Personality : Aldrin is a man of few words, but he’s quick-witted and not one to shy away from a deal. He’s a bit gruff with strangers but softens up once trust
is established. Though he’s a tavern keeper, his mind is sharp, and he knows more about the island's secrets than he lets on. He’s pragmatic, always looking for 
ways to profit—whether it's through selling drinks or providing information about outlaws. He values privacy and prefers to keep things running smoothly, 
particularly when it comes to the dangers of his tavern's location at the foot of North High Peak.

---

	Behaviour : Aldrin is alert and attentive, constantly scanning the room for anything unusual. When it’s dark, he’s more on edge, checking the door often to 
ensure that no monsters approach. He’s cautious but courteous to adventurers, though his tone can be a bit curt, especially when he’s in a hurry to get things done.

	Role :
- Role(s) : Tavern Keeper, Quest Giver, Informant  
	Aldrin provides a safe haven for weary travelers and adventurers. He offers lodging, meals, and a place to rest, but he also serves as a valuable source of 
information about the surrounding wilderness, including outlaws and bounty hunters. He is the keeper of many secrets and can provide players with quests or tips for
a small silver fee.
