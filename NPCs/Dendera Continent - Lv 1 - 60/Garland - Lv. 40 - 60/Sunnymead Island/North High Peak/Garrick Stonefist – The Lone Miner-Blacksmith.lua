			Garrick Stonefist â€“ The Lone Miner-Blacksmith  

	Location : Ironhowl Mine (Remote Mining Site, Near Rocky Cliffs)  

---

	Appearance : Garrick Stonefist is a burly, broad-shouldered dwarf with thick, soot-stained arms and a permanently furrowed brow. His long, braided beard is 
laced with iron rings, and his scarred hands show years of labor in the mines. His left eye is milky white, hinting at an old mining accident, but his right eye 
gleams like polished steel, sharp and perceptive.  

	He wears a heavy leather apron over a thick, sweat-stained tunic, and sturdy steel-toed boots built for the rough terrain. His work gloves are reinforced with 
metal plating, and a massive smithing hammer rests on his belt. When he moves, there is a metallic clank, as if he carries more tools than necessaryâ€”just in case.  

---

	Personality : Garrick is gruff, no-nonsense, and fiercely independent. He respects hard work above all else and has little patience for idle talk or those who 
havenâ€™t earned their place.  

	He enjoys sharing old mining tales over a strong mug of ale, but only with those he deems worthy. If approached by non-miners, he will be polite but distant, 
offering only basic blacksmithing services.  

> "You want work done? Then keep it short. Iâ€™ve got ore to smelt and rocks to break."  

	He is friendly towards miners but distrusts city folk and merchants, believing they take advantage of hard laborers. However, players who prove themselves as 
skilled miners will earn his respect, unlocking better quests and rewards.  

---

	Behaviour :  
- Spends most of his time workingâ€”either hammering at his forge or inspecting ore veins near the mine entrance.  
- Occasionally grumbles to himself about "lazy miners these days" or "how they donâ€™t make pickaxes like they used to."  
- At night, he retreats into his makeshift hut near the forge, though players may still hear him muttering or sharpening tools.  
- Will not engage in small talk unless the player has proven themselves.

	Role :  
- Role(s) : Mining-Exclusive Quest Giver, Blacksmith (Repairs & Basic Crafting)  
	- Provides Mining-related quests, teaches mining techniques, and offers gear repairs.  
	- Crafts basic mining tools and armor pieces made from raw ores, but does not offer legendary-tier equipment.  
	- Unlike standard Blacksmith NPCs, Garrick does not train Blacksmithing as a profession, nor does he sell advanced weaponry.

		- Mid-Quest :

			- "Careful. The deeper you go, the more unstable the rock gets. One wrong move, and youâ€™ll be digging your own grave."  
		- Completion :  
			- "Well, well. You made it back in one piece. Thatâ€™s rare. Guess youâ€™ve got more grit than most."

	Quotes :  
- "I donâ€™t waste time, and I donâ€™t suffer fools. You got business or not?"  
- "This forge ain't for show. Either bring me ore, or move along."  
- "Mining ain't just swinging a pick. Itâ€™s about knowing where to hit, when to dig, and when to run."  
- "You want real steel? You bring me real metal. None of that city-folk scrap."  
- "Bah! You call that ore? Thatâ€™s barely fit for a rusty horseshoe!"

- His respect must be earnedâ€”players who prove themselves in mining will gain access to better equipment and hidden quests.
