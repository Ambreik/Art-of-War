	1. Quest Title: The Lost Treasure of the Frostbound Adventurer

	Quest Overview : Legend has it that a famed adventurer, Korrik Frostblade, attempted the dangerous climb to uncover a treasure hidden at the summit's peak. 
However, Korrik disappeared in a violent snowstorm, leaving behind only cryptic journal entries and a trail of ice-bound markers. The quest involves retracing 
Korrik's steps and uncovering what happened to the adventurer—and potentially retrieving their treasure.

	- Use clues from the journal to understand the direction Korrik took on the climb.
2. Solve the Puzzle of the Frostbite Markers :  
	- Along the summit path, there are ice markers left by Korrik that seem to point to certain areas. Each marker contains a number and symbol that players must 
decode. The numbers correlate with certain rock formations at higher altitudes where Korrik left messages.
3. Survive the Blizzard’s Wrath :  
	- When players reach the final stretch of the climb, a supernatural blizzard erupts (triggered by a magical artifact left behind by Korrik), and the player must
use special Winter Totems (items found earlier) to protect themselves from freezing.
4. Retrieve the Frostbound Treasure :  
	- After overcoming the blizzard, find the treasure chest hidden beneath a pile of frozen rocks. The chest contains rare Iceforge Gems and Korrik's Frostblade, 
a weapon infused with cold magic.

	Rewards :  
- Frostblade (A rare sword that deals extra frost damage).
- Iceforge Gems (Crafting materials for powerful ice-themed armor or potions).
- Winter Totem (A one-time-use item that temporarily grants immunity to cold damage and slows down blizzards).
