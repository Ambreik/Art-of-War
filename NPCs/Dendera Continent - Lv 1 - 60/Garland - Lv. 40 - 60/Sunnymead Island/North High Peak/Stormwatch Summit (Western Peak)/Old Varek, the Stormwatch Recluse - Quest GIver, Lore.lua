			Old Varek, the Stormwatch Recluse  

	Location : Stormwatch Summit (Western Peak) – The Harsh Climb, Secluded Hut  

---

	Appearance : Old Varek is a weathered, grizzled man, likely in his late sixties. His long, frostbitten beard is streaked with white and grey, and his piercing 
icy-blue eyes hold the weight of many lost expeditions. His face is heavily scarred, a testament to years spent battling the unforgiving mountains.  
	He wears a thick, tattered fur cloak over layered leathers for warmth, and sturdy, frost-covered boots built for survival. His gloves are reinforced with steel 
plating, ideal for both climbing and defending himself. Across his back, he carries a wooden staff carved with ancient runes, though whether it is magical or simply
sentimental is unknown.  
	His posture is slightly hunched, not from weakness,but from years of fighting the wind and snow. He walks with purpose, but there is a caution in his movements,
as if always aware of the mountain’s dangers.  

---

	Personality : Varek is gruff, secretive, and deeply distrustful of those who seek treasure without respecting the mountain. He speaks in a low, gravelly voice, 
often muttering to himself or pausing mid-sentence as if recalling painful memories. Despite his harsh demeanor, he possesses a deep wisdom and will warm up to 
those who prove their worth.  
	He has a habit of speaking in riddles and cryptic warnings, preferring that adventurers uncover the truth themselves rather than rely on easy answers. Those who
dismiss his warnings or act arrogantly will find themselves swiftly ignored—or worse, led to their doom.  

> "You think you’re the first to come sniffing for treasure? The bones of the foolish litter these cliffs. If you’re smart, you’ll listen. If not… the storm will take you."  

	He respects those who show patience, caution, and respect for the summit, but despises reckless adventurers who only seek riches.

	Behaviour  
- Prefers to stay in his hut, only stepping outside briefly to check the sky or gather wood.  
- Speaks in short, deliberate sentences, sometimes lapsing into silence instead of answering directly.  
- Rarely shows emotion, but if pressed about his past, his hands tremble slightly, a hint of lingering trauma.  
- At night, players may hear him whispering to himself about past expeditions gone wrong.  
- If ignored for too long during dialogue, he mutters : *"Hmph. Wasting my time, are you?"* and returns to tending his fire.

	Mechanics

- Reputation : No direct reputation system, but Varek’s attitude toward the player changes based on how they interact with him (he will refuse quests if treated disrespectfully).  
- Interaction Limitations :  
	- Players must complete an initial task to gain his trust before he reveals true treasure locations.  
	- Certain quests require survival gear or climbing tools to access dangerous areas.  
- PvP : Cannot be attacked, nor does he engage in combat. However, players who try to rob or deceive him will find themselves led to false treasure locations (resulting in dangerous traps or high-level enemy encounters).  
- Respawn Time : N/A – Varek is a static, unkillable NPC.  
- Other Mechanics : Occasionally, during storms, Varek will offer insight on weather patterns that affect traversal in the area.
