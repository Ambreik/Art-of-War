			Harlan Tidechaser  –  Boat Rental NPC	
	
	Location : South Ram Port, Dockside

---

	Appearance : Harlan Tidechaser is a burly, salt-and-pepper-haired man with the rugged look of someone who’s spent decades at sea. His weathered face shows the 
signs of constant exposure to the sun and salt, while his hands are calloused and strong from handling ropes and sails. Harlan’s clothing consists of a simple tunic
and trousers, both slightly worn but practical, with a thick leather belt that holds a few nautical tools. His piercing blue eyes seem always to be scanning the 
horizon, and his voice carries the deep, calm authority of someone used to giving orders on the open water.  

---

	Personality : Harlan is straightforward and no-nonsense, speaking with the directness of someone who’s seen it all on the high seas. He values efficiency and 
punctuality, especially when it comes to boat rentals. While he doesn’t tolerate any nonsense, Harlan has a deep respect for those who venture into the water, 
understanding the dangers and rewards of life on the ocean. Though he can be stern, he’s also known for offering a fair deal and showing loyalty to those who have 
earned his trust. He’s quick to offer advice about navigating the waters but isn’t one to sugarcoat the risks involved.

	Role :  
- Role(s) : Boat Rental NPC, Travel Facilitator  
	Harlan operates the boat rental service at South Ram Port, assisting players who wish to travel across the sea to the continent. He offers different rental 
options depending on the player’s needs and preferences. His boats serve as a key method of transportation, especially for those looking to access distant shores or
specific locations.

	Mechanics :  
- Boat Rental Options :  
	- Rowboats : A cheap but slow option for players who want to travel without haste.
	- Fishing Vessels : Suitable for players who want to engage in fishing while traveling to distant shores. Slightly faster than rowboats but with the added 
benefit of allowing fishing during the journey.
	- Fast Transport : For a higher fee, players can instantly teleport across the sea to the continent. This is the most expensive option but offers the quickest 
travel.  

- Upgrade System : Players who have earned a high reputation with South Ram Port, particularly with Captain Oswin Drake, will have access to better boat rentals. 
These upgraded boats can provide faster travel, more storage space, or even additional features like enhanced fishing capabilities. 

- Skillable : Harlan is skillable, and players can improve their interactions with him, potentially lowering the cost of rentals or unlocking special deals and boat
upgrades based on their reputation with the port.

- Death and Respawn : Harlan is killable, and should this occur, he will respawn after 30 minutes. However, if players are present when Harlan is killed and do not 
intervene to assist him, a penalty is applied to any players who are around him when he respawns. The penalty means that these players will not be able to rent a 
boat from Harlan or repair a boat for 2 hours once he respawns.

- Penalty for Killing :
