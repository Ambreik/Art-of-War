			Gulliver Pike – Coastal Collector - Quest Giver

	Location : Sandy Shores  

---

	Appearance : Gulliver Pike is a rugged middle-aged man with a scruffy beard and sun-kissed skin. He wears tattered fishing attire, a wide-brimmed hat to shield 
his eyes from the sun, and carries a heavy leather pouch slung over his shoulder, filled with the treasures he collects from the shore. His posture is hunched from 
years of bending over collecting relics and shells, but his eyes gleam with curiosity and excitement.  

---

	Personality : Gulliver is an easygoing and somewhat mysterious character. He’s friendly and talks with a bit of a nautical twang, often making references to the
sea and its hidden secrets. He has a playful, almost whimsical side when he offers clues about treasures, but there’s also a sense of seriousness in his work, as if
he knows something that others don't. His tone can shift to one of caution when warning about the dangers of scavenging too deep into the coastal areas.
