			Rodrick “Rod” Lanneth – Shipwright

	Location : Dockside Shipyard, Portside District

---

	Appearance : Rodrick, known as "Rod" to most, is a burly man in his late 40s, with strong, calloused hands from years of working with wood and metal. His skin 
is tanned and weathered from long days spent in the sun, and his thick beard is flecked with grey. He wears a simple, sturdy work outfit—a leather apron over a 
loose shirt and trousers, both stained with the marks of his craft. His boots are worn but reliable, perfect for the uneven ground of the shipyard. Rod’s eyes are 
sharp, always assessing his surroundings, and his posture reflects the solid, grounded nature of someone who has spent a lifetime working with their hands. A 
toolbelt hangs low on his waist, holding the essentials for his trade, and his voice carries the weight of authority when he speaks.

	Personality : Rod is straightforward, practical, and dependable. He has little patience for small talk but appreciates the value of good craftsmanship and hard 
work. His gruff exterior hides a deeply caring nature, especially when it comes to the vessels he works on. He speaks with the confidence of someone who knows their
trade inside and out and can be a bit blunt at times, but never unkind. Rod has a deep respect for those who understand the sea and the importance of maintaining 
their vessels. He doesn’t tolerate laziness, and his sense of humor is dry, often laced with subtle sarcasm. While he doesn’t initiate many conversations, he’s 
always willing to share a few words of wisdom with those who ask about his craft.

	Behaviour : Rod spends most of his time overseeing the repairs of various boats and ships in the shipyard, moving from one vessel to the next with precision. He
is usually found near the docks or within his workshop, surrounded by tools and half-finished projects. Rod is methodical in his work and doesn’t like to be rushed.
If approached, he’ll assess the situation with a quick, discerning eye, offering his services or advice with a calm, yet firm demeanor.
