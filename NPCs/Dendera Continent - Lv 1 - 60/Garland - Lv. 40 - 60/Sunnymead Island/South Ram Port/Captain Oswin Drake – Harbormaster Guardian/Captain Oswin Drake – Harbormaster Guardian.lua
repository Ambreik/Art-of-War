		Captain Oswin Drake – Harbormaster Guardian

	Location : "Harbor" (Port Area)

---

	Appearance : Captain Oswin Drake is a weathered sailor in his mid-40s, his tanned skin showing years of exposure to sun and sea. His salt-and-pepper beard 
frames a stern yet wise face, and his piercing blue eyes glint with both authority and the thrill of adventure. He wears a practical yet well-maintained naval 
uniform, adorned with various insignias representing his rank. A long, dark trench coat billows behind him, a symbol of his position as the island's harbormaster. 
His posture is straight and commanding, his hands often resting on the hilt of a cutlass at his side, signaling his readiness to act when needed. On his belt, you 
can also spot a map pouch and a small compass, worn from years of use but still functioning.

---

	Personality : Captain Drake is a no-nonsense leader, known for his gruff yet just nature. He is fiercely protective of the island and its harbor, seeing it as 
his duty to maintain order and safeguard it from outside threats. While his interactions can seem blunt at first, those who earn his respect find that he has a deep
sense of loyalty and fairness. He's a master of reading people, and while he rarely shows his emotions, those who gain his trust will find him a steadfast ally. 
He's also a bit of a storyteller, sharing tales of his seafaring days when he's in a more relaxed mood, though these stories are often filled with exaggerated 
bravado. He commands respect but also demands it.

---

	Behaviour : When engaged in conversation, Captain Oswin is direct, often cutting to the heart of the matter. He is deeply involved in the safety of the harbor, 
keeping an eye on the docks and ships that come in and out. If a pirate or smuggler is spotted nearby, his demeanor becomes sharp, and his presence can be 
intimidating. He rarely lets his guard down, always staying alert for potential threats. He frequently walks along the docks, checking the cargo, ensuring that 
everything is running smoothly. Players who engage him in conversation can often sense a subtle tension in the air, a sign of the vigilance he maintains.
