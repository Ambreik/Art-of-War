			Elias “Eli” Buckler – Smuggler Contact  

	Location : Sailor's Tavern (Capital City, Smuggling Faction Base)

---

	Appearance : Elias “Eli” Buckler is a man with a scruffy, roguish look, somewhere in his mid-thirties. His dark, unkempt hair falls over his brow, and his rough
beard matches the disheveled style of his clothing—a dark, hooded cloak that allows him to blend in when necessary. Eli's eyes are always scanning the room, 
calculating, as though he’s never fully at ease. His hands, rough and scarred from years of handling goods in secret, often twitch toward his belt where a dagger 
rests. Though he blends in easily with the other patrons, there’s a certain edge about him, something that hints at danger beneath the calm surface.

	Personality : Eli is a man of few words, preferring subtlety and discretion in all his dealings. He’s shifty and secretive, with a sense of cold professionalism
about his work. He’s quick to offer deals for those in the criminal underworld or with smuggler reputations but won’t hesitate to cut ties if someone draws too much
attention. Eli speaks in riddles and half-truths, a master of the art of saying just enough to get his point across while never fully revealing his hand. He’s calm 
under pressure, but quick to vanish when things get too hot.

	Eli serves as the point of contact for those seeking covert operations in smuggling and illegal transportation. He works primarily with players who have 
criminal ties or a high reputation within the smuggler faction. Eli arranges discreet transport of illegal goods, provides smuggling quests, and offers a way for 
players to move about without the watchful eyes of authorities. His operations are centered around the Sailor's Tavern, a secret base for the faction in Capital 
City.

	Quotes:  
- "Looking for something... discreet, eh? You’ve come to the right man, but remember: what happens in the shadows stays there."  
- "Not many know this place... and fewer still know the way in. You’ve got the right look for it though."  
- "A little gold goes a long way, my friend. Just don’t get too cozy with the law. They’re never far behind."  
- "Careful with your mouth, stranger. The wrong words in the wrong ears, and you might be wishing for a quicker end."  
- "I’m not in the habit of talking too much. You want something done? Or do you just want to chat?"  
- "The authorities might be looking for me. Best if you don’t make eye contact when you leave."  
- "If you’re crossing lines, you’d best make sure there’s no one looking when you do."  
- "Smuggling goods isn’t a game. One wrong move, and you’ll be swimming with the fishes."  
- "You have the right contacts, the right reputation... That means you get the good jobs. The kind that pays well."  
- "Tread lightly, and don’t make waves. If the authorities catch wind of what we’re up to, it’s a long walk to the gallows."  
- "You’ll want to keep your hands clean, friend. When the law starts sniffing around, it’s not just the smuggling that gets you caught."
