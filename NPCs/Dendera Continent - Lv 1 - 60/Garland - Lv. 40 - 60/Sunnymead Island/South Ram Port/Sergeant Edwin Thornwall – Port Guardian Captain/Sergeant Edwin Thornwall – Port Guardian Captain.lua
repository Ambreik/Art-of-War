those around him. Though he is not overly warm, his focus is entirely on maintaining order and keeping the port safe. He can be reasoned with but never threatened, 
and he holds a deep disdain for those who engage in illicit activities. Despite his stern exterior, he has a deep sense of duty to the port and its citizens.
