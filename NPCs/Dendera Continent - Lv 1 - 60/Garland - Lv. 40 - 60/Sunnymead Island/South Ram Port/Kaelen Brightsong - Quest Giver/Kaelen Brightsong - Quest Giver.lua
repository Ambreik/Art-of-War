	Location : Sailor’s Tavern, Portside, near the Dock  

---  

	Appearance : Kaelen is a middle-aged man with a weathered, sun-kissed face, his long,wild hair streaked with gray. He wears loose-fitting, travel-worn clothing,
accessorized with various trinkets collected from his journeys—small pendants, seashells, and a few coins from distant lands. His eyes gleam with an adventurous 
spark, and his posture is relaxed, exuding a calm, enigmatic aura. He carries a worn, leather-bound journal full of notes and tales.  

---  

	Personality : Kaelen is a charismatic, easygoing individual, often lost in thought or deep in conversation. His love of storytelling is evident in his warm, 
engaging manner. He offers quests with the same passion and flair he uses when recounting the island’s history and lore. Kaelen enjoys a good drink and appreciates 
those who share in his curiosity about the past. His knack for weaving tales makes him both intriguing and persuasive, though he's known to playfully mislead 
players by feigning death for his own amusement.  

---  

	Behaviour : Kaelen enjoys conversing with players and may often distract them with stories. He can trick players into thinking he’s dead when they approach him 
after certain quest events, only to "revive" in front of them, laughing at their concern. He is a wanderer at heart, and his mysterious nature allows him to appear 
and disappear at will.
