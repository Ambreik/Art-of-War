			Eldric Runeweaver - Scribe Trainer NPC

---

	Location : The Windmere Rest, North High Peak, Sunnymead Island  

	Appearance : Eldric Runeweaver, now in his late sixties, has a frail yet dignified presence. His silver hair is tied back in a neat braid, and his face is 
etched with the lines of wisdom and years spent pondering the mysteries of the world. His scholar’s robes, deep blue and gold, shimmer faintly with ancient symbols,
while a leather satchel packed with scrolls, texts, and relics hangs from his shoulder. His hands, slightly trembled with age, are ink-stained from years of 
scribing ancient languages. Silver rings, etched with arcane runes, grace his fingers, and his deep-set eyes reveal a lifetime of accumulated knowledge.

	Personality :  
- Eldric is patient, contemplative, and methodical in his speech and actions. He speaks in a calm, measured tone, always considering the weight of his words before 
responding.  
- A lover of knowledge, he holds great respect for those who seek the truths hidden in the past and the stories etched in forgotten tomes.  
- Eldric believes that understanding is the key to wisdom, and he dislikes those who seek power without first grasping the consequences of their actions.  
- Often lost in his translations or musings, he tends to mutter to himself, absorbed in deciphering the old languages of the ancients.

---

	Behavior :  
- Eldric can be found sitting by the hearth of The Windmere Rest, scribbling notes from ancient tomes, or pondering over scrolls brought to him by adventurers and 
explorers.  
- On occasion, he steps outside to contemplate the mountain’s landscape, lost in thought, as if searching for some hidden truth among the peaks.  
- He is somewhat dismissive of those who show little interest in history or the mysteries of the world, offering them only a brief nod before returning to his 
studies.  
- At night, Eldric may be found in his study, translating fragments of ancient stone tablets brought in by explorers.
