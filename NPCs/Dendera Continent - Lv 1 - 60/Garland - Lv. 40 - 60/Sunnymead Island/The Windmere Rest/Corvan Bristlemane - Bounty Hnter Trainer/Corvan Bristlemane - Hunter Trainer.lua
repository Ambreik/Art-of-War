			Corvan Bristlemane  

	Location : The Windmere Rest, North High Peak, Sunnymead Island  

	Appearance : A rugged, middle-aged hunter with a weathered face, piercing amber eyes, and long, unkempt brown hair streaked with silver. He wears a thick fur-
lined cloak over hardened leather armor, reinforced with metal plating on the shoulders. A quiver of specialized hunting arrows rests on his back, and he carries a 
heavy crossbow strapped across his chest. His gloves are fingerless, revealing rough, scarred hands—evidence of years spent tracking and battling the dangers of the
mountain. His boots are caked in dirt, showing he rarely stays indoors for long.

	Personality : Gruff but fair, Corvan is a man of few words. He values practicality over pleasantries and prefers actions over idle talk. He respects those who 
prove themselves capable in the wild but shows little patience for reckless adventurers who underestimate the dangers of North High Peak. He has a deep respect for 
nature and believes that every predator, even the deadly Echo Wraiths, has its place in the world.

	Behavior :
- Often found sharpening his crossbow bolts at a corner table in The Windmere Rest.  
- Frequently steps outside to scan the mountain slopes for signs of movement.  
- Will only engage in meaningful conversation if the player shows interest in hunting or tracking.  
- Occasionally mutters under his breath about "the things that lurk in the night."
