			Corvan Bristlemane  

	Location : The Windmere Rest, North High Peak, Sunnymead Island  

---  

	Appearance : A rugged, middle-aged hunter with a weathered face, piercing amber eyes, and long, unkempt brown hair streaked with silver. He wears a thick fur-
lined cloak over hardened leather armor, reinforced with metal plating on the shoulders. A quiver of specialized hunting arrows rests on his back, and he carries a 
heavy crossbow strapped across his chest. His gloves are fingerless, revealing rough, scarred hands—evidence of years spent tracking and battling the dangers of the
mountain. His boots are caked in dirt, showing he rarely stays indoors for long.

	Personality : Gruff but fair, Corvan is a man of few words. He values practicality over pleasantries and prefers actions over idle talk. While he doesn’t 
actively seek company, he respects those who prove themselves capable in the wild. He has little patience for reckless adventurers who underestimate the dangers of 
North High Peak and often warns travelers to turn back if they aren’t properly prepared. Beneath his hardened exterior, Corvan carries a deep respect for nature and
believes that every predator, even the deadly Echo Wraiths, has its place in the world.

	Behaviour :  
- Often found sharpening his crossbow bolts at a corner table in The Windmere Rest.  
- Frequently steps outside to scan the mountain slopes for signs of movement.  
- Will only engage in meaningful conversation if the player shows interest in hunting or tracking.  
- Occasionally mutters under his breath about "the things that lurk in the night."

	Role :  
- Role(s) : Mountain Hunter, Quest Giver  
   - Offers bounty quests to eliminate hostile creatures near the peak.  
   - Specializes in tracking Echo Wraiths and other dangerous wildlife.  
   - Provides players with valuable survival tips for mountain exploration.

	Mechanics :  
- Type : Quest Giver, Hunter  
- Reputation : No faction alignment, but repeated assistance in his bounties increases his trust, leading to better rewards and exclusive tracking tools.  
- Interaction Limitations : Prefers to speak with players who have experience in combat or tracking. If a player lacks survival skills, he dismisses them outright.  
- PvP : Cannot be attacked—he is a neutral NPC.  
- Respawn Time : N/A (Non-combat NPC).  
- Other Mechanics :  
  - If players successfully complete multiple bounties, Corvan will provide them with an Advanced Hunting Kit, increasing their tracking efficiency.  
  - Certain nighttime encounters will only be revealed if players have spoken to Corvan beforehand, making his knowledge key to uncovering hidden threats.

- "You want to survive up here? Then stop acting like the top of the food chain."
