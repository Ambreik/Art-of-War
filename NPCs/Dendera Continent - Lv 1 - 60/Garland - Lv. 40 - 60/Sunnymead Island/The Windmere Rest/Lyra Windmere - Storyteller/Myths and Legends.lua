			Myths and Legends

	1. The Legend of the Wind’s Song
"It is said that the winds of North High Peak carry the voices of ancient souls, their whispers caught in the breath of the mountain. Travelers who listen closely, who attune themselves to the mountain’s rhythm, can hear the 'Wind’s Song.' Those who follow its melody are said to find hidden paths, forgotten chambers, and even the lost treasures of the Eldershade people. But beware, for if you follow the wrong note, you may find yourself lost in the mountain forever, never hearing the song again."

	2. The Curse of the Eldershade Guardians
"There are those who believe the guardians of Eldershade, stone protectors shaped by the hands of the ancient ones, still stand watch over the ruins even in death. It is said that on certain moonlit nights, the statues seem to stir, and those who disturb their slumber with greed or forceful intent will be cursed. The curse will take many forms: bad luck, the loss of precious memories, or even an unending wanderlust, forever seeking something they can never find. Only those who approach with reverence can hope to be granted the guardians’ blessing."

	3. The Lost Spirits of Eldershade
"The spirits of Eldershade are known to roam the ruins, their voices carried on the wind. Some believe these spirits are the restless souls of the ancient civilization that once thrived here, guardians of their forgotten knowledge. When the sun sets and the last light fades, the spirits become more active. Those who are pure of heart and respectful may catch a glimpse of the spirits, sometimes even receiving whispers of wisdom or forgotten truths. However, those who approach with disrespect are said to be met with terrible vengeance—ghostly hands reaching from the shadows, pulling them into the past, never to return."

	4. The Forbidden Relic of Eldershade
"Deep within the Sealed Chamber of Eldershade, an ancient relic is said to lie hidden. The relic, believed to be a gift from the gods, holds power unlike anything seen in the present day. Many have tried to reach it, but all have failed. Some say the relic is cursed, others believe it is a key to a power that could reshape the world. The chamber itself tests the worth of those who seek it—only the truly worthy can enter, and many have perished trying to decipher the runes. Still, the relic calls to those who dare venture close, whispering of its power and the great price that comes with claiming it."

	5. The Echoes of the Forgotten Ones
"In the quietest moments of night, when the winds are still and the mountain is asleep, travelers have reported hearing strange echoes—voices of the long-forgotten Eldershade people. These echoes are not simple sounds, but memories, vivid and alive. It is said that the Forgotten Ones, the civilization that built the ruins, left their memories behind in the very stones of Eldershade. Those who listen closely to the echoes may find themselves learning secrets long lost to time—secrets about the downfall of the Eldershade civilization and the hidden powers that led to their fall. Some believe that these echoes are trying to warn the world of a fate that awaits those who do not heed their lessons."
