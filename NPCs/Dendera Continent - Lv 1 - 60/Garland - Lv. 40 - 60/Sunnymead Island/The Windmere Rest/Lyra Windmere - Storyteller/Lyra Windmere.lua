			Lyra Windmere  

	Location: The Windmere Rest, North High Peak, Sunnymead Island  

---  

	Appearance: A slender woman in her mid-30s with piercing green eyes and long, dark auburn hair usually tied back in a loose braid. She wears a long, weathered
travel cloak with intricate embroidery along the hem, depicting mountain landscapes and ancient symbols. A leather satchel hangs at her side, filled with old 
parchments, journals, and an assortment of small trinkets collected from her travels. Her fingers are often stained with ink, and she carries an aged wooden staff, 
more for practical use in treacherous terrain than for combat.

	Personality: Curious, insightful, and slightly enigmatic, Lyra has a way of making even the simplest stories feel like grand adventures. She enjoys engaging in 
deep conversations about forgotten legends, lost civilizations, and the mysteries surrounding North High Peak. While warm and welcoming to travelers, she is 
secretive about her personal past, often dodging direct questions with a playful smirk. She has a habit of speaking in riddles and poetic phrases, making it 
difficult to discern if she’s offering wisdom or simply amusing herself.
