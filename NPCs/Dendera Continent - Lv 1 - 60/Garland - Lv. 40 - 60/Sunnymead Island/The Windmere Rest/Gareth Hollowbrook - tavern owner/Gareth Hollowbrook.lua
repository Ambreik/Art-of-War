			Gareth Hollowbrook

	Location : The Windmere Rest, North High Peak, Sunnymead Island

---

	Appearance : Gareth is a sturdy man in his late 50s, with a thick salt-and-pepper beard and sharp, watchful eyes that seem to read every traveler before they 
even speak. He wears a well-worn brown leather coat over a woolen tunic, his sleeves often rolled up as he tends to the tavern. A simple iron pendant, rumored to be
a keepsake from his younger days as a sailor, hangs from his neck. His hands, rough and calloused, tell stories of both hard labor and brawls fought within the 
tavern's walls.

	Personality : Gareth is a no-nonsense but fair tavern keeper, known for his wisdom and sharp wit. He has a habit of sizing up travelers with a single glance and
can tell a seasoned adventurer from a fresh recruit instantly. Despite his gruff demeanor, he has a soft spot for those in need and will share his knowledge with 
those who earn his trust. He enjoys storytelling but rarely speaks about his own past. His rules are simple: no unnecessary brawling, respect the house, and pay 
your dues.
