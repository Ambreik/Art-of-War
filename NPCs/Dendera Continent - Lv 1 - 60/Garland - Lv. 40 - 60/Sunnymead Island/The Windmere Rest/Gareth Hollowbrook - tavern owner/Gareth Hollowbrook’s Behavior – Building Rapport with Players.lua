			Gareth Hollowbrook’s Behavior – Building Rapport with Players  

	Gareth Hollowbrook is not one to immediately trust strangers, especially those who come asking too many questions. While he is a natural storyteller, he is also
a seasoned tavern keeper who has seen his fair share of troublemakers, treasure hunters, and reckless adventurers who don’t make it back down the mountain. His 
willingness to share valuable information depends on how well a player earns his trust.

		Stages of Rapport Building & How It Affects His Behavior  

	Stage 1: Cautious but Polite (First-time Visitors)  
- Gareth will greet new players warmly but keeps conversations surface-level.  
- He shares only common knowledge, such as directions, well-known myths, or general rumors about North High Peak and The Windmere Rest.  
- If players ask about sensitive topics like the Echo Wraiths, the Hidden Path, or lost relics, he deflects with vague responses or jokes:  
  - “Aye, plenty of folk come looking for answers, but not all like what they find. Best enjoy a drink instead.”  

	Stage 2: Familiar Acquaintance (After Multiple Interactions or Minor Favor)  
- Gareth starts recognizing the player and engages in longer conversations.  
- He drops small but useful hints about treacherous paths, lost artifacts, and old legends, but nothing too revealing yet.  
- Players who buy drinks, food, or chat frequently will notice that Gareth offers slight discounts and occasional free refills.  
- He becomes less dismissive of rumors and may tell a few personal experiences:  
  - “That old path? Aye, I heard the wind speaking of it before… though not everyone believes me.”  

	Stage 3: Trusted Confidant (Completing a Quest for Him or The Tavern)  
- Gareth fully opens up and shares detailed information that leads to hidden quests or rare discoveries.  
- He acknowledges certain secrets of The Windmere Rest, such as the true nature of the Echo Wraiths or the meaning behind old inscriptions in the tavern.  
- He gives warnings about dangerous locations that only experienced adventurers should attempt to explore.  
- He offers private rumors instead of telling them to a general audience:  
  - “Come closer, friend. There’s something you ought to know… but it stays between us.”

	Ways to Build Rapport with Gareth  
1. Consistent Interaction – Regularly visiting The Windmere Rest and engaging in conversations with him over time.  
2. Buying Food & Drinks – Purchasing from his tavern shows appreciation and support.  
3. Helping with Tavern-related Quests – Assisting Gareth or NPCs tied to the tavern.  
4. Demonstrating Knowledge of Local Legends – If a player references information they learned from other sources, he respects them more.  
5. Avoiding Aggressive Behavior – Threatening or harassing Gareth (or his customers) will cause him to withhold information permanently.

	Failing to Build Rapport – The Suspicious Treatment  
If players act rudely, cause disruptions in the tavern, or try to intimidate him for answers, Gareth becomes visibly wary.  
- He refuses to engage in further conversation.  
- Prices in his shop increase significantly for the player.  
- He warns other NPCs about the player, reducing the likelihood of receiving help from them.  
- In extreme cases, he may alert Corvan Bristlemane, the mountain hunter, to keep an eye on the player.
