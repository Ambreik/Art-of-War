			Limited Storage Mechanic: Temporary Stash Space

	Overview : Gareth allows trusted or regular customers to store items temporarily in a secure space within *The Windmere Rest*. This stash is separate from the 
player’s personal inventory but is tied to Gareth’s reputation and the player’s frequency of visits. This system can offer convenience, especially for adventurers 
who need to offload items before heading into dangerous areas or exploring.

	Core Features

1. Storage Access :  
	- Only players who have completed a specific number of quests or frequent Gareth's tavern regularly (based on interactions) will gain access to this stash.
	- Gareth's willingness to offer storage increases as the player builds rapport (through quest completion, purchasing items, etc.).

2. Capacity :  
	- The stash will have a set number of slots or a weight limit (to prevent abuse). For example, it could be 20-50 slots of inventory space or a specific weight 
allowance that scales as the player progresses.
	- The stash is temporary, meaning players can store items for a limited time (e.g., 24 hours in-game time) before they must retrieve them or they will be 
automatically removed.

3. Conditions for Use :  
	- Players can store a wide variety of items (weapons, armor, potions, resources) in the stash.
	- Items that are too valuable or powerful (e.g., unique quest items or high-level gear) might be restricted from storage, maintaining the balance of using it 
for "traveling" items.
	- If the player’s stash is full, they can’t store new items until something is removed or retrieved.

4. Usage Restrictions :  
	- Limited Access : Once a player has access to the stash, they can retrieve or add items freely during normal interactions with Gareth, but the stash could be 
locked or temporarily inaccessible during certain events (like when Gareth is busy or if the tavern is under attack).
	- Reputation-based : Players with low trust or negative reputation with Gareth might have restricted access or higher fees for storing items.

5. Fee/Cost :  
	- Gareth might charge a small fee for using the storage space, like a percentage of the value of stored items. This fee could be waived for those with high 
trust or if a specific questline has been completed.
	- Alternatively, storage could be free, but access is based on completed quests or other in-game milestones.

6. Automatic Retrieval :  
	- Time Limit : After a certain amount of time, items will be automatically returned to the player’s inventory if they fail to retrieve them. This could help to 
limit abuse of the system and encourage regular visits to the tavern.
	- Reminder System : Gareth might warn players when their storage time is about to expire, giving them a chance to retrieve items or face losing them. This can 
be integrated into dialogue options or a quest tracking system.

	Lore Integration and Dialogue

- Gareth’s Role in Storage :  
	"I’ve got a bit of room out back where travelers can stow their things. I won’t hold your sword for you forever, mind, but it’s safe enough for a time."
  
- Trust Building :  
	- “I’ll give ye a spot for your things, but only if I trust ye. Don’t be going around telling strangers where I keep my little stash.”

- Usage Dialogue :  
	- "I’ll keep that for ye for a while, but make sure ye don’t forget about it. I’ve got plenty of other customers to look after."
	- "It’s not free, y’know. But I’m fair. Pay what’s owed, and your things are safe till ye need ‘em again."

	Visual / UI Considerations

- Storage Interface :  
	- A simple UI for the stash, separate from the player's inventory. It would show items that are in storage and provide an option to deposit or retrieve items.
	- Could show item types like weapons, food, resources to help players easily identify what they’ve left behind.
  
- Notification System :  
	- A visual reminder on the player's HUD or map that indicates when the stash time is running out or if they have unused space.

	Balancing the Mechanic

- Advantages for Players :  
	- It provides a handy way to store bulky or non-essential items without needing to return to town. This is useful for players exploring dangerous zones like 
North High Peak.
	- Encourages repeat interactions with Gareth, adding depth to his role as an NPC.

- Limiting Abuses :  
	- The temporary nature of the storage prevents players from abusing the mechanic by stashing large quantities of items indefinitely.
	- The system can also limit the types of items that can be stored (e.g., not allowing rare or valuable quest items to be stored), preventing exploits.
