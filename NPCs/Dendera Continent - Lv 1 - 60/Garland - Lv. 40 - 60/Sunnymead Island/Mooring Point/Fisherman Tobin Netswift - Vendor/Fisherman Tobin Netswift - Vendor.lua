			Fisherman Tobin Netswift  

	Location : Sunnymead Island – Mooring Point  

---

	Appearance : Tobin Netswift is a rugged, middle-aged fisherman with sun-kissed skin, salt-and-pepper hair, and a scruffy beard. His weathered hands tell tales 
of years spent battling the sea. He wears a thick, dark blue fishing coat with patches, sturdy boots caked in dried salt, and a wide-brimmed hat to shield his eyes 
from the sun. A leather belt holds various fishing tools, and a harpoon rests against the dock beside him. His presence is always accompanied by the scent of the 
ocean and the faint aroma of smoked fish.  

---

	Personality : Tobin is gruff but warm-hearted, speaking in a deep, gravelly voice. He has little patience for idle chatter but is always willing to share a tale
or two about the mysteries of the deep. Though he initially appears reserved, he respects those who show dedication to fishing. He enjoys teasing newcomers but will
readily offer advice to those who prove themselves. His humor is dry, often laced with references to past fishing mishaps and superstitions about the sea.

	Behaviour :   
- Spends most of his time at the docks, either repairing nets, checking bait, or looking out at the horizon.  
- Occasionally hums old sea shanties or mutters about the “one that got away.”  
- When approached, he sizes up players with a skeptical look before engaging in conversation.  
- At night, he can sometimes be found gutting fish near a small lantern, selling fresh catches to travelers.
