			Varlo "Whisper" Draeven  

	Location: Various secretive locations (typically near docks, hidden alleyways, or abandoned buildings)  
- Most frequently spotted at Moonshadow Cove, Rustwater Docks, or Fogveil Alley (depending on the region).  
- Only appears between midnight and dawn (in-game time).

	Appearance : Varlo is a shadowy figure with a lean but wiry build, always draped in a long, dark coat with a high collar that obscures most of his face. His 
eyes gleam with a mix of cunning and danger, constantly scanning his surroundings for potential threats. A few visible scars line his knuckles, hinting at a past 
filled with violence. Underneath his coat, he wears a mix of practical leather armor and loose, dark fabrics that help him blend into the night. He always keeps his
hood up, and a dagger is ever within reach on his belt. His presence is often accompanied by the faint scent of salt, rum, and damp parchment.

	Personality : Varlo is smooth-talking, calculating, and never fully honest. He speaks in a quiet, almost hypnotic tone, making it hard to tell whether he's 
warning you or manipulating you. He doesn't trust easily and dislikes small talk—unless it serves a purpose. While he may seem cold, he respects those who prove 
themselves competent in the Smuggler's. He has a strict personal rule: "No needless violence—unless absolutely necessary." If players gain his trust, they'll find 
that he keeps his word… most of the time.

- Disappears instantly if guards or hostile NPCs approach.  
- Will only speak to players who have either:  
	- Completed a previous smuggling quest OR  
	- Have Reputation Rank II or higher with the Smuggler's Faction.

- Varlo is a dynamic NPC, meaning his location, quests, and shop inventory change each night.
