			Shipwright Calder Morn

	Location : West Side Docks, Angle’s Haven (Capital City Island) – Near Sailor’s Tavern

---

	Appearance : Calder Morn is a middle-aged man, in his late 40s, with a weathered but strong appearance. His hands are calloused and rough from years of working 
with wood, nails, and ropes. His skin is sun-kissed, a tan that speaks of endless hours on the docks and at sea. He has short, salt-and-pepper hair, and a neatly 
trimmed beard that adds to his gruff demeanor. His blue eyes are sharp and observant, ever watching the waves and ships that come into port. Calder wears a thick 
leather apron over a simple shirt, reinforced with patches of weathered fabric, and his trousers are tucked into worn boots. He often carries a few tools—saws, 
hammers, and chisels—strapped to his belt. His posture is sturdy and confident, with a slight slouch from years of bending over boats.

	Personality : Calder Morn is a no-nonsense, direct individual with little time for idle chatter. He speaks in a low, gravelly voice, often cutting straight to 
the point. While he isn’t outright unfriendly, his gruffness can make him seem distant, especially to those who aren’t in need of his skills. He’s passionate about 
his work, seeing boats and ships as extensions of himself. His trust is earned through hard work, and he values those who respect the craftsmanship that goes into 
his trade. He’s protective of the ships that come under his care, often giving blunt advice on how to treat them properly. Despite his hard exterior, he shows a 
soft spot for sailors who’ve been through rough seas and knows the importance of a good repair job.

---

	Behaviour : Calder is methodical and precise in his actions. When a ship comes in for repairs or upgrades, he inspects it thoroughly, muttering under his breath
about the wear and tear. If approached while working, he’ll likely give a curt response,saying that his time is valuable and the work will take as long as it takes.
However, once a bond is formed, he might be a bit more open, offering advice or sharing a story about a particularly tough repair job. He rarely leaves his work 
area but can be found near the docks at all hours, surveying ships.

	Role :  
- Role(s) : Craft NPC, Vendor  
	Calder Morn’s main role is to repair and upgrade ships. He offers basic ship repairs as well as more specialized upgrades such as enhancing durability, speed, 
or stealth capabilities. He can also provide hidden compartments for smugglers who need extra space for contraband. As a vendor, he occasionally sells rare 
materials or blueprints for advanced ship modifications to players who have earned his trust.

	Mechanics :  
- Type : Vendor, Craft NPC  
- Reputation : None, but loyalty to the Smugglers’ Syndicate could unlock more specialized upgrades, such as stealth enhancements or hidden compartments.
- Interaction Limitations : Calder will only offer upgrades and repairs to players who own ships or boats. Certain ship upgrades require faction reputation with the
Smugglers’ Syndicate or Trust Level 2 with Calder for special modifications.
- PvP : Not flagged for PvP, as Calder is considered neutral and primarily focuses on his craft. He cannot be attacked, but any damage done to his workshop or tools
will result in increased prices and slower services.
- Respawn Time : Instant, as Calder doesn’t “die” in the traditional sense but may be unavailable for brief moments while repairing ships.
- Other Mechanics :  
	- Ship repairs require materials such as wood, nails, and cloth, depending on the severity of the damage.
	- Special upgrades like hidden compartments are unlocked only after certain Smuggler Syndicate quests are completed or after earning Trust Level 2 with Calder.

	Quotes :  
- "A ship’s no good to anyone if it ain’t seaworthy. You want to last out there, best keep it in shape."  
- "Don't bring me no wrecks, mate. I’ve got better things to do than patching up boats that should’ve been scrapped."  
- "I can make your ship faster, stronger, or stealthier. But it'll cost you. You’ll need to prove you're worth the trouble."
