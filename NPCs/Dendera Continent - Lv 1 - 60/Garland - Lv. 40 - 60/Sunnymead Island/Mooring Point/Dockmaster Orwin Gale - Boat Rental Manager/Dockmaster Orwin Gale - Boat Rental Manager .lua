			Dockmaster Orwin Gale  

	Location : Sunnymead Island – Mooring Point (Boat Rental & Dock)  

---  

	Appearance : Dockmaster Orwin Gale is a middle-aged man with a weathered face, tanned from years of working under the sun. His short, graying hair is always 
messy from the salty sea breeze, and a scruffy beard gives him a rugged but experienced look. He wears a simple blue sailor’s vest over a linen shirt, with knee-
length cargo pants and heavy leather boots, always damp from seawater. A belt with a ring of keys hangs at his side, and a spyglass dangles from a rope around his 
neck, which he frequently lifts to inspect the horizon. His hands are rough and calloused, showing years of rope-handling and ship work.  

---  

	Personality : Gale is gruff but fair, treating seasoned sailors and newcomers with the same no-nonsense attitude. He doesn’t tolerate reckless sailors and 
expects players to respect the dock rules. However, he has a soft spot for eager learners, showing patience when explaining boat mechanics. While he often complains
about irresponsible renters, he secretly enjoys helping newcomers find their sea legs. His dry humor and straight-to-the-point speech make interactions with him 
short but memorable.
