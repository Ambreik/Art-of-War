			Lioran Stoneguard – Guardian of the Ruins

	Location : Ruins of Eldershade, Southern Peak of North High Peak, Sunnymead Island

---

	Appearance : Lioran Stoneguard is a towering half-orc, his body covered in intricate tribal tattoos that tell the tale of his people’s history. His thick, dark 
green skin is weathered from years of guarding the ruins. His eyes, a piercing amber, seem to see through both man and myth alike. He wears a mix of leather armor 
and ancient stone pauldrons, symbols of his dual commitment to both the land and the secrets within the ruins. He wields a massive stone greatsword engraved with 
runes that glow faintly at night.

---

	Personality : Lioran is stoic and deeply protective of the ruins. He has a deep respect for the ancient people who once inhabited the area, seeing himself as 
their living sentinel. Though his demeanor may be intimidating, he is not inherently hostile, and will only act if the sanctity of the ruins is threatened. He 
speaks with an authoritative tone, but his words carry wisdom and restraint, preferring action over idle chatter. Lioran has little patience for those who seek to 
plunder the ruins for profit.

---

	Behaviour : Lioran can be found patrolling the edges of the ruins, often standing motionless in front of an ancient carving or doorway, as if in silent 
communion with the past. He reacts to players who approach the ruins aggressively by issuing a warning or even challenging them to a duel. He will not hesitate to 
protect the ruins from any who would desecrate them.
