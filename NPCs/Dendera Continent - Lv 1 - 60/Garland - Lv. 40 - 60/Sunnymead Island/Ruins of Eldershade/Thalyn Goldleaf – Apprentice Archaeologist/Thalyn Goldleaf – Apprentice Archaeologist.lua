			Thalyn Goldleaf – Apprentice Archaeologist

	Location :  
Ruins of Eldershade, Southern Peak of North High Peak, Sunnymead Island  

---

	Appearance : Thalyn is a young elf, around 22 years old, with sharp features that hint at his elven heritage. His hair is a tousled mess of golden strands, 
often windblown from his work in the ruins. His emerald-green eyes are constantly scanning his surroundings for clues, reflecting his sharp intellect and insatiable
curiosity. He wears light leather gear, suitable for exploration, and a well-worn satchel hanging at his side, filled with tools and sketches. Over his attire, he 
has a brown, dirt-stained cloak, which he uses to protect himself from the harsh environment while working in the ruins. His movements are quick and precise, 
betraying years of training in navigating rocky landscapes.

	Personality : Thalyn is highly enthusiastic about archaeology, often diving into long-winded explanations about his latest discoveries. He’s incredibly friendly
and loves to engage with players, sharing his excitement for uncovering the secrets of the past. While he’s approachable and eager to chat, his intense focus on his
work sometimes makes him oblivious to the bigger picture. He’s genuinely passionate about preserving history, even if it means spending weeks or months at a time 
in dangerous and isolated locations. He’s driven, but also slightly scatterbrained, often losing track of time or forgetting to eat when he’s deep in his studies. 
He sees every new discovery as a small piece of a much larger puzzle.

	Behaviour : Thalyn can often be seen sketching relics or inspecting the ruins when idle. When players approach, he’ll look up with a bright smile, eager to 
share his latest theories or findings. If the player engages in conversation, he might wander off while talking, continuing to search the surroundings for 
additional details. Thalyn’s enthusiasm can sometimes spill into his actions, and he may rush into areas that aren’t entirely safe, though he is more interested in 
discovering relics than fighting enemies.
