		Reputation-based Merchant Shops

	In addition to the regular stores, the "Market District" has specialized shops that can only be accessed by players who have gained a certain reputation level 
with specific factions or NPCs. These shops are small and hidden away in different parts of the district. These merchants may offer rare and powerful items that 
cannot be found elsewhere.

1. The Hidden Vendor (Reputation or Gift-Based)
	- Exterior : A small, inconspicuous door tucked in a dark alley. The merchant only appears if the player has gained a certain reputation with a faction or 
received a special gift.
	- Items Sold : Rare accessories, potions, and artifacts that can only be acquired through special means.

2. The Lost Merchant (Reputation or Gift-Based)
	- Exterior : This merchant runs a mysterious booth, covered in cloth, that only appears under certain weather conditions or after the player has completed a 
specific quest.
	- Items Sold : This merchant offers a limited stock of magical items and rare quest items, including things like unique rings, enchanted books, and special 
materials.
