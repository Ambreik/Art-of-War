	Appearance : 
- Guard 1 : A tall, burly male guard with a stern expression. He wears a dark leather tunic, reinforced with steel plates on the chest and shoulders. 
His short, dark hair is tucked under a weathered helmet, and his sharp blue eyes scan the surroundings vigilantly. He carries a large, menacing sword 
strapped to his back. His armor shows signs of wear but is well-maintained.
- Guard 2 : A slightly shorter female guard with an athletic build, exuding confidence and discipline. She wears a similar set of dark leather armor, 
with a distinctive green cloak that blends into the environment. Her hair is tied in a tight bun, and she carries a bow across her back, ready for 
quick action. Her expression is serious, but there’s a sense of calmness to her demeanor.

	Personality :  
- Guard 1 : Stoic and serious, the male guard has a no-nonsense attitude. He’s focused on his duty and rarely speaks unless necessary. He’s quick to 
take action when provoked but prefers to remain watchful and unobtrusive.  
- Guard 2 : Though equally serious about her duties, the female guard has a slightly more approachable air. She is sharp-witted and observant, always 
looking for potential threats. While not talkative, she is more likely to engage with travelers if they are near the patrol path.
