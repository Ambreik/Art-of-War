			Perky Hook

	Location : "Fortte Lake", Northeastern part of "Dendera - Isfield Territory".

---

	Appearance : "Perky Hook" is a middle-aged man with a weathered face and a confident smile. His tanned skin is a sign of many days spent under the
sun, and his light, worn-out clothes are covered in patches from frequent encounters with the elements. His hair is messy, often tied back in a simple
knot to keep it out of his face. A pair of old but well-maintained boots, perfect for standing in the shallow waters of the lake, complete his look. 
His most distinctive feature is the large fishing rod he carries — a tool of great pride, crafted with skill and experience.

	Personality : Perky Hook is a laid-back but dedicated fisherman, always with a welcoming attitude toward fellow anglers. He speaks with a deep, 
gravelly voice, often telling stories of the "big catch" or giving advice on fishing techniques. Despite his easy-going nature, he is known to have an
unshakable focus when it comes to fishing — he doesn't mind sharing tips, but only with those who have truly earned his respect. He values patience, 
skill, and perseverance in his craft, and he’s always willing to lend a hand to anyone with a genuine interest in fishing. Perky is a firm believer in
the "slow and steady" approach, and he rarely rushes into anything, preferring to let things happen at their own pace.

	Role : Perky Hook serves multiple purposes within the game. He is primarily a "Quest Giver", offering players tasks related to fishing in 
"Fortte Lake". He also functions as a "SHOP", where players can purchase various fishing-related items such as baits and fishing rods. In addition, he
is a "Crafting NPC", capable of crafting specialized fishing rods and a select range of fishing baits for skilled fishermen. Perky Hook is only 
accessible to players who have chosen the "Fisherman" profession and can offer a series of unique quests and crafted items that enhance a player's 
fishing abilities.
