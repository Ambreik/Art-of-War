			Merchant (Weapons): Dael Ironfist

	Appearance : "Dael" is a tall, broad-shouldered man with short black hair and a thick beard. His clothing is simple, but his arms are thick with 
muscle, evidence of his work in the forge. He stands behind a table covered in finely crafted weapons of all kinds, from swords to axes.

	Personality : Dael is friendly but direct. He enjoys a good conversation about weapons and combat, but he’s all business when it comes to a sale. 
His passion for weaponry is only matched by his desire to see the right weapon in the hands of the right person.

	Role : "Vendor"

	Location : "Pirsky Village", next to Laria’s stall, where weapons are displayed for sale.

	Mechanics :  
- Vendor : Sells various weapons (low-level to mid-tier swords and other weaponry).  
- No PvP Flag : Dael is not targetable for PvP and only functions as a vendor.

	Quotes :  
- "A weapon is only as good as the hand that wields it."  
- "What’s your preferred weapon? A sword, an axe, or something more unusual?"  
- "A blade in the right hands can change the tide of a battle."
