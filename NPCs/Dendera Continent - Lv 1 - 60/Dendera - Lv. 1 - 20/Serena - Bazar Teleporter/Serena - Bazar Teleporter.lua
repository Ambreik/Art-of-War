	Personality : Serena is a calm, enigmatic figure who moves through the world with a quiet confidence. She doesn’t engage in conversation, and her interactions 
are limited to her role as a teleportation guide. Serena’s presence is calm, but there is something ethereal about her, almost as if she exists outside of time. She
remains professional in all her dealings, offering teleportation services without much personal flair. Despite her businesslike manner, there’s a sense of quiet 
charm in her demeanor—though she rarely lets anyone get too close. Serena’s focus is entirely on her duty, helping players get to the Bazaar and back to the major 
cities with efficiency and grace.

	Role :  
- Role(s) : Teleportation Service Provider  
	Serena’s primary function in the world is as a teleportation NPC, offering players the ability to travel between the **Bazaar** map and major cities for a fee. 
This makes her an essential figure for those who wish to access the Bazaar’s trade opportunities, offering swift and reliable transportation across regions. 
	- Teleportation Mechanic : Serena does not provide quests, nor does she engage in commerce as a shopkeeper. Instead, her sole service is teleporting players to 
and from the Bazaar, and from there, players can visit major cities. This service comes at a cost, which varies depending on the distance and specific city to be 
reached.  
	- Fixed Locations : Serena can be found in every major city and human settlement across the game world, serving as a gateway between locations. She is always 
accessible to players who need to travel quickly.

	Mechanics :  
- Type : Teleporter NPC (No quests, No shop, No targetable)  
- Teleporter Mechanic : Serena offers a one-way teleportation service, sending players to the **Bazaar** map for a sum of money. From there, players can move on to 
major cities or continue their trade business within the Bazaar area.  
- Service Fee : The teleportation fee depends on the location and distance, varying across factions. The fee is usually set at a reasonable rate to ensure players 
are able to access the Bazaar without excessive cost.  
- Non-Targetable : Serena cannot be attacked or interacted with beyond her teleportation service. She is untouchable by players in combat and cannot be a quest 
target.  
- No Quests or Shop : She does not provide any quests or act as a vendor. Serena’s sole interaction with players is through her teleportation service.

	Behavior :  
- Serena maintains a serene, neutral stance at all times. She does not speak to players unless it concerns her teleportation services. Upon approaching her, players
will be given the option to pay for teleportation to the Bazaar.  
- When players approach, she simply nods and, upon receiving payment, will begin the teleportation process. Serena’s movements are smooth and practiced, a display 
of how long she has been offering this service across the lands. She remains at her post until the teleportation is complete, then silently resumes her position, 
awaiting her next customer.  
- While Serena does not interact much with players beyond her teleportation service, there is a hint of quiet power in her. She is always present in major cities, 
quietly moving between settlements as if her role in the world is pivotal, though players rarely see her actively involved in anything outside of her specific task.
