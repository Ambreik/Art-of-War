			Charon, the Ferryman

Appearance: A tall, ethereal figure cloaked in dark robes, with a face obscured by a hood. His skeletal hand grips a long oar, which he uses to navigate the waters of the Black River.
Story: Charon has ferried souls across the river for centuries. He takes pride in his duty, believing that every soul deserves safe passage, whether to the Underworld or back to the human realm.
Location: Found at a lone dock along the banks of the Black River, surrounded by mist.
Mechanics: Players must pay Charon a fee to cross the river. He provides safe passage and can offer information about the destinations, including potential dangers.
