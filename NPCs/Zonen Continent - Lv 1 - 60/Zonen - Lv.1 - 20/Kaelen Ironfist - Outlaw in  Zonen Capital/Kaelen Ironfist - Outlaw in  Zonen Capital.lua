			Kaelen Ironfist - Zonen Capital

	Appearance : Kaelen Ironfist is a towering figure, broad-shouldered and muscular, with a physique that speaks to years of hard training and battle. His silver 
hair, cropped short and slightly tousled, contrasts with the harsh lines of his face. A single, deep scar runs across his nose, a mark of his brutal history in 
combat. His gray eyes are sharp and calculating, revealing little emotion but always observing his surroundings with quiet intensity. His armor is worn but sturdy, 
crafted from thick plates of metal that have seen countless battles. Faded symbols of ancient warrior clans can still be faintly seen etched into his armor, though 
time has worn them down. The armor is practical, heavy, and designed for long endurance, with no adornments for show—only function. The rhythmic clink of metal 
accompanies his every step, a reminder of his constant readiness for battle.  end

		Abilities and Skills :

1. Iron Fist Strike : Kaelen’s signature combat move, where he channels his raw strength into a crushing blow that can stagger or incapacitate enemies. This move is
devastating in close combat and often leaves opponents with broken bones or disoriented for a short time.

2. Tactical Command : Kaelen is an expert tactician. His ability to command troops and inspire loyalty boosts the morale of those around him. When leading others 
into battle, his presence alone increases the effectiveness of his allies by 10-20%.

3. Unyielding Will : Kaelen has trained his body and mind to withstand almost any pain or injury. This passive skill grants him resistance to debuffs like fear, 
paralysis, or slow effects and allows him to continue fighting even when his health is dangerously low.

4. Warrior’s Resilience : His resilience allows him to recover quickly from fatigue or wounds. When injured, Kaelen can passively regenerate a small amount of 
health over time, allowing him to continue fighting longer than most warriors.

5. Battle Focus : A special ability that lets Kaelen focus his strength and energy for a short period. During this time, his attack power and defense are both 
greatly increased, but his mobility is reduced.

6. Armor Mastery : Kaelen is highly skilled with heavy armor. He receives less damage from attacks while wearing it and can endure longer in combat without tiring 
or becoming slowed by the weight.

		Interactions :

- With Allies : Kaelen is a mentor and a stern leader, pushing those around him to be their best. He values loyalty and will go to great lengths to protect his 
comrades, but he also expects them to prove their worth through actions rather than words. He will often give advice to younger or less experienced warriors, though
his advice is blunt and practical.

	- Quote when addressing a new recruit : "You want to fight beside me? Then prove you’re strong enough to stand in my shadow."

- With Players : Kaelen has little tolerance for those who are indecisive or weak, but if a player proves themselves in battle or through loyalty, he will offer his
support. He can provide combat training and tactical advice, though only to those who show a willingness to learn and improve.

	- Quote when interacting with a player : "You seek my counsel? Good. But remember this—action speaks louder than words. Do not waste my time with questions if you are not ready to fight."

- With Enemies : Kaelen’s cold demeanor can be intimidating to enemies, and he’s known for his ability to stay calm under pressure. When confronting enemies, he 
speaks with authority, and those who face him often realize too late that they underestimated his skill and resolve.

	- Quote when confronting an enemy : "You’ve made a grave mistake coming here. I hope you’re ready to pay the price for it."

- With Renara the Swift : Kaelen’s no-nonsense attitude contrasts with Renara’s agility and speed. Though they may disagree on tactics at times, they share mutual 
respect for each other's strengths. Kaelen sees her as a valuable ally, but only if she can keep her head in battle.

	- Quote when interacting with Renara : "Swift? Yes. But speed won’t save you when you’re surrounded. Do not let your confidence be your downfall."

- With Guards : As a respected leader, Kaelen expects the guards to maintain discipline and order within the capital. He often inspects the defenses and ensures 
that the city remains prepared for any threats, offering praise when it’s due but showing disappointment when standards slip.
