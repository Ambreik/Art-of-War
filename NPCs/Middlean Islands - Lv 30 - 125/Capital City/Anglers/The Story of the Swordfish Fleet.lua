			The Story of the Swordfish Fleet

	In the mist-shrouded coastal village of Narrawind, nestled between towering cliffs and endless ocean swells, there was a clan revered for its unmatched mastery 
of the sea. This clan, led by a fisherwoman named "Elara", became known as the "Swordfish Fleet". In an age when survival depended on the bounty of the ocean, 
"Elara" and her clan members became famed for their ability to catch the most elusive and powerful of all fish—the swordfish. 

	"Elara" was a master navigator, a woman whose knowledge of the tides, stars, and shifting currents gave her an uncanny ability to find schools of fish that 
others could scarcely dream of. Under her leadership, the "Swordfish Fleet" developed a unique technique of hunting: using specially crafted, long harpoons and 
sleek boats capable of slicing through treacherous waters. These small, agile vessels allowed them to maneuver closer to the swordfish schools, often in waters 
dangerous to anyone who lacked their skill and bravery.

		The Fleet's Legendary Journey

	One dark season, during the onset of the "Second Great War", the oceans seemed to withhold their gifts. The swordfish population dwindled, leaving the village 
hungry and desperate. In response, "Elara" rallied her clan, preparing them for a journey further into the uncharted waters of the "Outland Sea". With her at the 
helm, the "Swordfish Fleet" sailed into unknown depths, passing through treacherous storms and braving monstrous waves. After days of struggle, they finally 
encountered a great school of swordfish in the deep ocean, where they engaged in an epic hunt, catching enough to bring prosperity back to the village.
	Their return became the stuff of legends. The fleet bond and bravery echoed through generations as the "Swordfish Fleet's Legacy", a tale that spoke of 
resilience, honor, and an unbreakable kinship with the sea. Over time, this tale was woven into the identity of two families—the "D Family" and the "L Family"—the 
direct descendants of "Elara's" brave clan.

		Present Day: The Divided Descendants

	As time passed, the "Swordfish Fleet" legend took root in two distinct family branches: the "D Family" and the "L Family". Though united by ancestry, their 
lifestyles and methods have diverged. The members of these families now carry forward the legacy of Elara in their own unique ways.

		The D Family 

1. "Carp Barbeau D." – The middle brother, Carp is a lively and skilled fisherman. He runs the "Freshwater Plunge" in "Capital City", where he offers a series of 
chain quests starting at level 42. These quests involve tracking down rare fish, gathering ingredients, and occasionally facing challenges tied to the family’s 
ancient lore.
2. "Oscar Fisher D." – The oldest brother, Oscar has withdrawn deep into the forests of "Netar Island" (a place we'll explore further). He owns a secluded shop called "Rainbow Trout Goldmine", where he sells rare fish and offers hidden quests to those brave enough to seek him out.
3. "Sushi Vischer D." – The youngest brother, Sushi is the family’s traveler and alchemist. He roams the seas on his boat, collecting exotic ingredients for 
crafting fishing lures. He frequently returns to **Freshwater Plunge** to visit Carp and offer players unique recipes and fishing tips.

		The L Family 

1. "Curty L." – As the oldest of the L Family, Curty runs the "Anglers’ Shelter" on the west side of "Capital City". Known for his steady hand and traditional 

fishing methods, Curty offers wisdom and beginner quests for aspiring anglers.
2. "Erny L." – A famous angler and the second oldest of the L Family, Erny is based at "Anglers' Shelter" alongside Curty. He is respected throughout Capital City 
for his expertise in deep-sea fishing and often challenges players to catch rare, elusive fish.
3. "Sharpe L." – The youngest and most unpredictable, Sharpe only appears during the "Fish Trap Mania" event in "Capital City". He is known to stir up a frenzy 
during these competitions, rewarding players with rare catches and event-specific items. He can often be seen in the Commercial Plaza, rallying anglers to the 
contest.
4. "Ted Willy L." – An adventurous spirit, Ted wanders the streets of "Capital City", sharing stories of the "Swordfish Fleet" and challenging players to catch 
different types of fish as they roam.

		The Legacy of the Swordfish Fleet

	Though these two families differ in approach, they are united by the legacy of "Elara the Navigator" and the spirit of the "Swordfish Fleet". Whether navigating
deep waters, crafting lures, or sharing old tales, the D and L families carry forward the resilience, skill, and love for the sea that defined their ancestors. Each
family member has unique quests, items, and challenges, allowing players to engage deeply with the enduring legend of the Swordfish Fleet and its role in the 
history of the "Second Great War".
