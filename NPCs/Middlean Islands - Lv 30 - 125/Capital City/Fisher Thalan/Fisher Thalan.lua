			Fisher Thalan

		Description :   
	"Fisher Thalan" is a seasoned fisherman who embodies the spirit of the sea. He is a rugged-looking man in his late 40s, with sun-kissed skin and a weathered face
that tells stories of countless days spent at sea. His hair is tousled and peppered with gray, often tied back in a loose ponytail. "Thalan's" deep-set, azure eyes
mirror the ocean's depths, reflecting both wisdom and a hint of mischief.
	"Thalan" is typically dressed in a simple, worn linen shirt and durable trousers, ideal for his work on the docks. He wears a faded fishing vest filled with tools
of his trade, such as nets, hooks, and bait. A wide-brimmed hat shields his face from the sun, and a weathered fishing rod is often slung over his shoulder. 
Around his neck hangs a small talisman made from a seashell, believed to bring good luck during his fishing trips.

		Location :   
	"Fisher Thalan" can be found on the bustling decks of "Capital City", specifically near the "Fishermanâ€™s Wharf". This area is alive with the sounds of seagulls,
the crashing of waves, and the chatter of merchants and locals selling their daily catch. The decks are lined with boats of various sizes, some bobbing gently in the
water, while others are being unloaded with crates of fresh seafood.

	"Thalan" often interacts with other fishermen, sharing tales of his adventures at sea and offering advice to newcomers. His presence at the wharf not only makes
him a beloved figure among the local fishing community but also serves as a connection between the people of "Capital City" and the resources of the "Great Sea".

		Context for Quest Initiation

sea and its currents can also lead players to unique locations or hidden treasures within the "Great Sea", making him a valuable NPC for players looking to explore 
the underwater realm.
