			Lyria the Whisperer - Capital City

	Location : Lyria the Whisperer resides in "Capital City", within the "Great Library" , a secluded, dimly lit place nestled beneath the city’s grand archives or 
"Sailor's Tavern". The library is a hidden gem, filled with scrolls, books, and manuscripts from eras long past. Only those who are trusted or deemed worthy can 
gain access. Lyria often lingers in the shadows of the library’s labyrinthine corridors, gathering knowledge, listening for whispers of secrets that others wish to 
keep hidden. Occasionally, she may be found in the "The Gloomy Lantern", a private gathering place where only those who know of her presence are allowed to enter.

	Appearance : Lyria’s presence is subtle yet commanding. She is draped in shadowy, muted clothing that seems to blend seamlessly with the darkness around her, 
making it difficult to discern where she ends and the shadows begin. Her attire is simple yet elegant, often consisting of dark silks and cloaks that flow 
gracefully with her movements. Her hair, as dark as midnight, cascades over her shoulders in soft waves, adding to her ethereal, almost ghostly appearance.
	Her eyes are perhaps her most striking feature—dark, unreadable, and always intense, as though they hold the secrets of the world within them. When she locks 
eyes with someone, it feels as though she can see into their very soul. There is a quiet power in her gaze, one that often leaves those who meet it feeling both 
unnerved and compelled to speak truths they may not have intended to share.
	Lyria’s expression is often neutral, though a faint, knowing smile may occasionally play at the corners of her lips when she observes something of interest. She
moves with a fluid grace, like a shadow in the night, never rushing, always deliberate.

	Personality : Lyria is a woman of few words, and even fewer that are spoken aloud. She thrives in silence, listening more than speaking, and always observing 
the world around her with a watchful eye. Her quiet nature doesn’t equate to a lack of strength—in fact,it is in her silence that her power lies. She is perceptive,
able to read people and situations with unsettling accuracy, often knowing what others are thinking before they even say it.
	Her love of knowledge is matched only by her obsession with secrets. Lyria understands the value of information, especially the kind that can be used as 
leverage. She collects secrets like others might collect treasures, storing them away in her mind for future use. Her loyalty to Aranil’s memory runs deep, though 
she keeps this allegiance well hidden. Only a select few know the depth of her devotion to the fallen leader, and she goes to great lengths to keep her feelings 
concealed. 
	Lyria’s demeanor is calm and composed, but there is an underlying intensity to her actions. She doesn’t trust easily, preferring to work from the shadows and 
maintain control over every situation. Though she is not easily swayed, Lyria does hold certain allegiances dear, and those who earn her trust will find a quiet but
steadfast ally. She is careful with her words, speaking with calculated precision and always considering the consequences of each sentence.
