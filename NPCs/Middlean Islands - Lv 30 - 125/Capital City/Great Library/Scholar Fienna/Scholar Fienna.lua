			Scholar Fienna
			
	"Scholar Fienna" is a vibrant and dedicated researcher in her late twenties, known for her deep connection to the underwater world and the "Naga culture". She 
has a slender, athletic build, reflecting her active lifestyle spent exploring the depths of "Vashthara". Fienna’s long, wavy hair shimmers like the colors of the 
sea, transitioning from a rich turquoise to a deep azure, mirroring the aquatic environment she loves. Her bright green eyes are filled with an insatiable curiosity
and determination, often sparkling with excitement when discussing her latest findings.

	Dressed in practical yet stylish attire, "Fienna" favors fitted tunics adorned with delicate sea motifs and leggings that allow for easy movement. A leather 
belt cinches her waist, holding various pouches filled with research notes, herbs, and small artifacts collected during her expeditions. She often dons a 
lightweight cloak that resembles the colors of the ocean, which billows gracefully around her as she moves. "Fienna's" fingers are often stained with ink from her 
constant note-taking, and a friendly smile is never far from her lips, welcoming anyone eager to learn about the mysteries of the "Naga" and the treasures hidden 
within their realm.
