			Thalos, the Shadows Hunter
- **Appearance**: Thalos resembles an assassin, cloaked in a darkish green robe with a hood for enhanced stealth. He wears black boots that enable swift movement. In his sheath, he carries a long sword, while two short knives are always in his hands, ready for quick strikes. His agility allows him to pierce any armor with his attacks.
- **Story**: Thalos roams the Underworld, hunting monsters to gather essential materials for NPCs in Eldergate. His mission extends beyond mere hunting; he creates safe paths along the main routes for players and seeks information about mini-bosses and the "7 Bullets of Horror" scattered across the realm. He monitors their spawn times and informs players, saying things like, "In 7 minutes, Mortar, the Black Dragon of Shadows is spawning at his original place," or "All Bullets of Horror are killed; next respawn is pending."
- **Location**: Frequently seen near the Gloom Gardens and other shadowed places, but he travels extensively across the Underworld.
- **Mechanics**: Thalos assists players by:
  - Killing monsters to loot materials needed by Eldergate NPCs.
  - Creating safe paths on main routes to ease player navigation.
  - Gathering intel about mini-bosses.
  - Tracking the "7 Bullets of Horror" and notifying players of their spawn times.
  - Guiding players to important locations, such as "Sangaria," and marking these on their minimaps.
