		Backstory of Spirit Healers  

	In the beginning, when the "Underworld Realm" was formed as a bridge between the world of the living and the dead, it was ungoverned chaos. Souls 
wandered aimlessly, falling prey to the horrors of this desolate plane. Sensing the need for balance, the "Ethereal Pantheon"—a council of ancient, 
benevolent spirits—created the "Spirit Healers".  
	These entities were designed to embody the bridge between life and death, guiding lost souls and protecting those who ventured into the Underworld
Realm. Over millennia, they have become the keepers of humanity's remnants, safeguarding the fragile connection between realms.  
	While powerful, the Spirit Healers are bound by strict laws of neutrality. They cannot interfere directly in mortal affairs but can offer aid to 
those in dire need. Their existence is a testament to the balance that must be maintained within the cosmos, where life and death are but two sides of
the same coin.
