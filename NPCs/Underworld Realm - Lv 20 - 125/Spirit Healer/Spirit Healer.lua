			Spirit Healer

	The "Spirit Healers" are angelic beings encountered in the "Underworld Realm", dedicated to aiding adventurers in their journey through this 
treacherous realm of death. Representing a balance between life and death, they offer vital services for survival and progression.

		Lore and Purpose
	Spirit Healers are guardians of humanity’s remnants in the "Underworld Realm", acting as a bridge between the living and the dead. They are not 
mere NPCs; they embody powerful, ethereal protectors.

	Mechanics and Features
1. Healing :
   - Restores health and mana to full for players who interact with them.
   
2. Protection :
   - Temporarily shields players in their vicinity from Underworld creatures.

3. Item Repair :
   - Repairs items with zero durability at a moderate cost. Some rare or cursed items might require special quests to repair fully.

4. Morale Boost :
   - Grants a "temporary buff" to courage and spiritual power, increasing stats like resilience and magic resistance for a limited time.

5. Teleportation within the Realm :
   - Allows teleportation between Spirit Healer locations, helping players navigate the Underworld more easily.

6. Return to Normal Realm :
   - Can teleport the player back to their original realm, usually at a cost such as reduced durability or limited use over time.

	Locations
1. Grand Spirit of Void :
   - Found in the northern side of the realm, near a dangerous dungeon. Situated on a hill surrounded by rivers.
   
2. Spirit of the West :
   - Located in the western part of the realm.

3. Spirit of the East :
   - Positioned in the eastern part of the realm.

4. Spirit of the South :
   - Resides in the southern area.

5. Spirit Healer of Highland :
   - Found in the center of the realm. Unique among Spirit Healers, they also act as a **Questgiver**.

	Dialogue and Interaction
- When spoken to, they say:
   - _"It is not yet your time."_  
   - _"I shall guide your journey back to the realm of the living."_

- Selecting the "Return me to life" option triggers:
   - Warning about item durability:  
     _"If I resurrect you, all of your items will take up to 25% durability damage (equipped and inventory)."_
   - Players must confirm the resurrection through an **Accept/Cancel** prompt.

- When idle or when a player is nearby, Spirit Healers may shout:
   - _"I have heard the cries of many humans in this realm of death."_  
   - _"I shall mark you, that you may pass into this realm and easy to bring you back!"_  
   - _"Be warned, you have no power in this place. Only those who reach a higher spiritual consciousness can be free here as well!"_  
   - _"Try as you might, you may not be able to reach lower places here easily as you are now."_  
   - _"You must become wiser and stronger to defeat those monsters that walk in this realm!"_

	Mechanics for Resurrection
- Choosing to be resurrected at a Spirit Healer imposes the following penalties:
	- All items (equipped and inventory) lose 25% durability.
	- A "temporary debuff" (e.g., reduced strength or stamina) lasting 5–10 minutes.

	Unique Characteristics
- Immortal NPC : Spirit Healers cannot be targeted by players (PvP flag disabled).
- Most Powerful NPCs : They possess immense power and cannot be harmed by any entity.
- Skillable NPCs : Players who reach higher ranks in specific professions (e.g., Spiritualism or Alchemy) may unlock special interactions, such as reduced resurrection penalties or additional teleportation options.
