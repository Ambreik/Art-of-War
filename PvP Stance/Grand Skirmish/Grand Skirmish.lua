			Grand Skirmish
			
	Grand Skirmish or Party PvP is similar with "Heroes' Ascent" but require a party of 2 or 3 people and is accessed from "Rypere Phil" located in 
"Middlean Islands \Capital City".
	Once a character reached 70 level, can start adventure as being part of a group , where is able to request or to be requested for a duel maximum 10 times a 
day. Before being able to do this, first must create a party at the same NPC, where have to type down the name of his members that he want to group with. Once
this was completed, a checking message is sended to those characters with a 30 seconds confirmation. A window pop-up in the middle of the screen that cannot be moved
away nor closed until answer with "ACCEPT" or "DECLINE". Once party is set, leader can access second line from "Rypere Phil" where can start seeking for another party
to duel with. When one was found, this group is asked if want to accept the skirmish by "ACCEPT" or "DECLINE" botton. Other way is to type down as the same NPC the
name of the leader of the target party. end 

	For each participation, every character gain by default 2 "Insignia" plus an extra for their performances such as 
*Winner gain 13 "Insignia"
*loser gain 5 "Insignia".

	Mechanics are the same as "Heroes' Ascent".
	Once duel was accepted in 5 seconds both participants will be teleported to the arena and the duel will start in 10 seconds.
	Duration of a duel is not capped but if any of the participants cause any damage to the opponent in a minimum of 10 seconds, a worning is applied for next 5 
seconds where after duel is over in a draw and both receive 0 "Insignia" and lose once attempt.
	Once the duel is over, both will be teleported to the location that was before. end

mount, on return they will be near to the location but on ground and apply a "Protection Arena Buff" if is around "Aggro" monsters with a duration of 10 seconds.end
