			Arrysa's Pride Ship

		Description

	"Arrysa's Pride Ship" stands as a testament to the artistry and craftsmanship of the master crafters of the Zonen continent. This remarkable sailing vessel 
combines functionality with aesthetic appeal, constructed primarily from high-quality hardwood. Its rich mahogany finish not only enhances its visual elegance but 
also provides exceptional durability against the harsh elements of the sea. Treated with marine-grade sealants, the wood ensures longevity and superior performance 
during voyages.
	At the bow, a small sail is elegantly positioned for maneuverability, expertly designed to catch lighter winds. Complementing this, two imposing sails at the 
stern, crafted from reinforced canvas, maximize wind capture, allowing the vessel to glide effortlessly across the waters. Adorned with intricate patterns that 
reflect the ship's name, these sails add a touch of artistry to its formidable design.
	The spacious deck of "Arrysa's Pride Ship" features polished teak wood, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. A large saloon situated on the side of the deck
serves as a comfortable retreat for passengers. This saloon boasts a stylish bar, crafted from the same mahogany as the hull, offering a selection of fine spirits 
and refreshments. With elegant bar stools and ambient lighting, this area is perfect for relaxation and socialization during the journey.
	A striking figurehead, intricately carved in the shape of a woman, graces the rear of the ship, embodying grace and strength. This artistic feature not only 
enhances the ship's visual appeal but also pays homage to the spirit of adventure and exploration that defines its journey.
	To ensure resilience against the sea's perils, the bottom layer of the ship is sealed with iron planquettes. These metal plates provide additional protection 
against water intrusion and marine pests, ensuring that "Arrysa's Pride Ship" remains seaworthy and ready for its next adventure.
	In summary, "Arrysa's Pride Ship" is a harmonious blend of craftsmanship and design, featuring a robust wooden structure, impressive sails, a luxurious saloon, 
and artistic embellishments that make it a true marvel on the water.

		Mechanics:

* Players are not affected by the fatigue zone for the whole duration of the trip.

* Players can initiate PvP duels, but both must be in "FREE PvP Stance." No other players can interfere unless an NPC enters the duel radius.
* Players can drink until they become tipsy, leading to in-game effects like screen wobbling and potential vomiting.
* Mounts, pets, and Guardians/Barons cannot be used on the ship.
