	Junkboxes are the first junkboxes that "outlaws" will encounter on their pickpocketing spree. These usually contain no more than a few copper and an item of 
mundane or Vendor Trash worth, though they may occasionally contain raw gems or a Healing potion or a Poison for use on their weapons.
	Sturdy boxes found on 60+ mobs are noticeably more valuable. From the mobs in the Desolace zone, these junkboxes contain rogue poisons, ability materials, Healing 
Potions, and a higher money content.
