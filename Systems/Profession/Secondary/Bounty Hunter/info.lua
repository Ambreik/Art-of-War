	Bounty Hunter Restraint Items**  

1️⃣ **Binding Orb** – A magical orb that, when thrown at a criminal, **immobilizes them for 10 seconds** (cannot move, attack, or use teleport abilities). Works only if the target has an active bounty. *Cooldown: 2 minutes.*  

2️⃣ **Seal of the Law** – A rare sigil that **traps the criminal in a "pocket prison" for 20 seconds**, preventing escape. After the timer expires, the criminal is **teleported near the closest city or settlement** (based on the system we created). If the criminal is already in a city, they are **moved outside** and must deal with the penalties we designed. *Cooldown: 5 minutes.*  

3️⃣ **Tracker’s Cuffs** – A pair of enchanted shackles that **prevent a criminal from mounting, teleporting, or using invisibility for 1 minute.** If the criminal logs out, their character remains in the game for 10 additional seconds. *Cooldown: 3 minutes.*  

4️⃣ **Hunter’s Chain** – A throw-able chain that **pulls the criminal toward the Bounty Hunter from a distance of up to 20 meters.** Also **reduces movement speed by 30% for 10 seconds.** *Cooldown: 1 minute.*  

5️⃣ **Warden’s Brand** – When activated, this brand **marks the criminal on the minimap** for all Bounty Hunters within a certain range (e.g., 500 meters) for 2 minutes. This makes it harder for criminals to escape unnoticed. *Cooldown: 10 minutes.*

Each of these items would require **Bounty Hunter Rank Progression**, meaning newer hunters won’t have access to the strongest tools immediately. They can buy them from:  
- **Bounty Hunter Trainers** (major cities, Outland Territories, or special faction locations).  
- **Bounty Hunter Special Vendors** (could be tied to faction reputation or a guild).  

Would you like me to integrate this as a section into the Bounty Hunter system? Or do you want any adjustments/additions?
