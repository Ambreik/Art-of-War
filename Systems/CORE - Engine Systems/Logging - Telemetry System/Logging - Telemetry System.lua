			Logging / Telemetry System

	Path : `GAME/Systems/Logging_Telemetry_System.lua`
	Type : Core Support System
	Purpose : Collects, stores, and processes all relevant gameplay data — from player interactions and combat logs to AI behavior, trades, and network sync events.
	Relation : Feeds insights to developers, GMs, and automated systems (e.g., anti-cheat, economy balance).

	1. Introduction

	The "Logging / Telemetry System (LTS)" provides a comprehensive, real-time record of world activity.
	It acts as the black box of the game — capturing key gameplay events, player actions, network synchronization, and AI decision outputs for analysis, debugging, 
and balance evaluation.

	This system ensures transparency and accountability, both for live moderation (e.g., GM tools) and backend analysis (e.g., identifying exploits, tuning combat 
formulas, or balancing the economy).

	2. Core Mechanics / Functionality

	A. Event Logging

	Every critical system emits log entries via the "Event Bridge" :

* Combat Logs : Damage dealt, received, mitigated, reflected.
* Interaction Logs : Trades, duels, group joins, chat interactions.
* AI Logs : Behavior decisions, state transitions, and aggro table updates.
* Network Logs : Connection syncs, replication errors, and latency snapshots.
* World Logs : Spawn/despawn events, item pickups, quest completions.

	Each log entry includes:
* Timestamp
* Player/NPC IDs
* System origin (Combat, Trade, Sync, etc.)
* Context metadata (e.g., skill name, item ID, location zone)
* Result (Success/Fail/Error)

	Logs are serialized and stored in batches to minimize server load.

	B. Telemetry Data Collection

	Beyond discrete logs, telemetry captures continuous data streams:

* Player movement heatmaps (for pathfinding analysis).
* Average combat duration per region or monster type.
* Economic statistics (trade frequency, gold inflow/outflow).
* Connection quality metrics (latency, packet loss).
* AI decision distribution (fight/flee ratio, detection rates).

	This enables analytics dashboards and automated alerts, helping to identify design flaws or emergent player behaviors.

	C. Data Categorization

| Category          | Description                       | Example Data                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Gameplay**      | Actions performed by players/NPCs | Damage events, trades, duels     |
| **Network**       | Synchronization and latency data  | Ping, dropped packets            |
| **Economy**       | Item and currency movement        | Gold inflow/outflow, trade value |
| **AI Behavior**   | Decision outcomes                 | “Flee triggered” frequency       |
| **System Health** | Server and script performance     | CPU, memory, tick rate           |

	3. System Integration

| Connected System              | Purpose                                        | Example                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Global Combat System**      | Records detailed combat logs                   | Skill damage, resistances, deaths               |
| **Player Interaction System** | Tracks trades, duels, and PvP kills            | “TradeCompleted” or “PlayerKilledPlayer” events |
| **Network Replication Layer** | Monitors desync and packet integrity           | “OutOfSyncEvent” triggered                      |
| **Event Bridge**              | Unified entry point for all system signals     | “onEventLogged” hook                            |
| **World Sync Layer**          | Records state discrepancies or delayed updates | Zone load mismatches                            |

	4. Administrative & Debugging Tools

| Command                    | Description                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `/log combat [player]`     | Shows recent combat log entries for player/NPC |
| `/log trace [system]`      | Monitors live feed from a specific system      |
| `/telemetry region [zone]` | Displays live telemetry metrics for region     |
| `/analyze economy`         | Outputs summary of economic inflow/outflow     |
| `/report latency [player]` | Displays recent network stability metrics      |

	5. Storage & Optimization

* Logs are stored in segmented databases (Combat, Trade, Network, etc.).
* Supports real-time streaming for live monitoring (GM dashboards).
* Implements compression and archival rotation to reduce overhead.
* Older logs (30+ days) auto-compress and move to archival storage.
* Telemetry aggregated hourly or daily depending on data type.

	6. Use Cases

1. Exploit Detection : Identify rapid item duplication or abnormal trade patterns.
2. Combat Replay : Replay PvP or PvE encounters for balance testing.
3. AI Debugging : Examine failed decision chains or stuck behaviors.
4. Server Performance Tracking : Diagnose lag spikes, tick drops, or desyncs.
5. Economy Balancing : Analyze gold sinks vs generation.
6. Cheat Prevention : Monitor suspicious movement or interaction logs.

---

	7. Future Expansions

* Visualization Dashboard : Real-time analytics for admins and developers.
* Automated Alerts : System flags abnormal activity automatically.
* Machine Learning Integration : Predictive analysis for exploit detection.
* Cross-Shard Log Consolidation : Aggregate multi-server data for global metrics.
* Replay Generator : Create event-based replay logs for cinematics or postmortems.

---

	8. Implementation Notes (DB/AI)

* Each major system calls `LogEvent(eventType, eventData)` through the "Event Bridge".
* Database schema uses indexed tables:
	* `combat_logs`
	* `trade_logs`
	* `ai_behavior_logs`
	* `network_logs`
* Implement async batching with write queues to prevent server lag.
* Telemetry aggregators run in background threads, updating dashboards periodically.
