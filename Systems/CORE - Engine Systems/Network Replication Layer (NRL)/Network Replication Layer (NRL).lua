			Network Replication Layer (NRL)

	Path : `GAME/Systems/Network_Replication_Layer.lua`
	Type : Core middleware / Networking system
	Purpose : Authoritatively synchronize world state (AI, combat, events, entity positions, status effects) between server(s) and clients with low-latency, secure, and bandwidth-efficient replication tailored to an MMORPG environment.

---

	1. Introduction

	The NRL is the authoritative conduit for multiplayer state. Its goals:

* Keep client views consistent with the authoritative server while enabling responsive gameplay.
* Minimize bandwidth through interest-management, priority replication, and delta encoding.
* Ensure determinism where needed and server-side validation to prevent cheating.
* Provide hooks for higher systems (AI Decision Layer, Global Combat System, Event Bridge, Awareness) to publish state changes safely.

	NRL is built for scalability (zoned / sharded servers), high concurrency, and reliability in the face of network jitter and client disconnects.

---

	2. Core Responsibilities

* Authoritative State Management : Server holds definitive state; clients are recipients and requesters.
* Interest Management : Only send state to clients that need it (nearby, in-LOF, same instance, engaged).
* Delta & Snapshot Replication : Send compact deltas; occasionally full snapshots for resync.
* Event Replication & Ordering : Timely propagation for important events (combat, AI state changes, rare spawns).
* Prediction & Reconciliation : Client-side prediction for responsiveness; server reconciliation to correct divergence.
* Security & Validation : Server-side checks for actions (damage, movement, item use).
* Scalability : Partitioning/world zoning, cross-shard event routing.

---

	3. Data Model & Message Types

	Define message schema and types (protobuf/flatbuffers/JSON depending on stack):

	Entity State Messages

* `EntityTransform` — position, rotation, velocity, timestamp.
* `EntityStateDelta` — health, resources, buff/debuff list deltas.
* `EntityLifecycle` — spawn, despawn, death, respawn.

	AI / Awareness Messages

* `AIStateUpdate` — awareness flags (idle, investigating, alerted), target id, lastSeenPos.
* `ThreatTableSnapshot` — optionally for debugging or limited replication.

	Combat & Effects

* `CombatEvent` — hit, crit, miss, heal, resource drain (server authoritative).
* `StatusEffectUpdate` — apply/remove debuffs, stacks, durations.

	Event Bridge Messages

* `WorldEventNotify` — rare spawn, quest update, local event triggers (scoped).
* `PersistentStateSync` — persisted world state flags.

	Control & Meta

* `SnapshotRequest/Reply` — resync mechanics.
* `ACK/Heartbeat` — keepalive and latency stats.

---

	4. Consistency Models & Guarantees

	Mix models for different needs:

* Eventual Consistency (low-priority : Ambient sounds, cosmetic effects, minor ambient NPC states.
* Soft Real-Time (gameplay-critical : Positions, basic AI states, health bars — replicated with frequent updates and reconciliation.
* Strong Consistency (server-authoritative : Damage calculations, loot drops, quest completions, rare spawn state — server decides, clients observe.

---

	5. Interest Management & Spatial Partitioning

	Avoid broadcasting everything to everyone.

* Zones / Shards / Instances : World split into server regions; cross-region messages routed via a gateway.
* Spatial Partitioning : Use grid / quadtree / k-d tree to find relevant clients for entity updates.
* LOF / Occlusion Filters : Combine Interest with line-of-sight or interior/room checks where needed (e.g., stealth).
* Role-based Subscriptions : Subscribe clients to additional feeds (party updates, raid-wide events, guild channels).
* Dynamic LOD (Level-of-Detail) Replication : Near clients get full state; further clients get reduced frequency or coarse data (e.g., health percentage only).

---

	6. Delta Encoding, Compression & Bandwidth Optimizations

* Delta Encoding : Only send state changes relative to last known client snapshot for that entity.
* Event Compression : Aggregate multiple minor events per tick into a single message.
* Bit-packing & Typed Fields : Use compact encoding for frequent small fields (flags, small ints).
* Adaptive Tick Rates : High-priority entities (near players, in combat) replicate more frequently than idle distant entities.
* Interest-based Throttling : Reduce update frequency for clients with poor bandwidth to preserve gameplay-critical packets only.

---

	7. Prediction & Reconciliation

	To keep gameplay responsive:

* Client-side Prediction : Local simulation for movement and immediate effects (visual) while waiting for server acknowledgment.
* Server Reconciliation : Server sends authoritative corrections when client diverges beyond tolerance, with smoothing to avoid visible snapping.
* Rollback / Reapply : For deterministic interactions (e.g., certain spell projectiles), server may instruct clients to rollback a few frames and re-simulate with 
authoritative inputs.

---

	8. Event Ordering & Reliability

* Reliable vs Unreliable Channels : Use UDP-like fast transport with reliable wrappers for important events (combat hits, loot, state changes). Use unreliable for 
frequent, replaceable data (transforms).
* Causal Ordering : Ensure dependent messages preserve order (e.g., spawn → buff → damage).
* Sequencing & ACKs : Sequence numbers and acknowledgements for reliable flows and snapshot resyncs.
* Idempotency : Design messages so replays or duplicates are safe (e.g., apply buff only if not present or if timestamp newer).

---

	9. AI & Awareness Replication Patterns

	AI has a lot of internal state; replicating everything is expensive — be selective:

* Authoritative AI on Server : AI decisions run server-side (AIDL). Clients only receive limited AI signals needed for local visuals and threat display.
* State Summaries : Send compact states (Idle, Investigating, Alert, Combat) + target ID + lastSeenPos.
* Threat Compression : Only replicate fine-grained threat tables for debugging sessions or for the party leader in special modes 
(keep normal players’ clients light).
* Event-driven AI replication : AI state changes trigger immediate replication to subscribers (e.g., player in sight → AIStateChange).

---

	10. Combat State Replication

	Combat must feel precise:

* Authoritative Combat Events : Server computes hits, crits, resists, and applies them; emits `CombatEvent` to clients.
* Client Feedback : Clients display hit FX immediately via prediction but accept server corrections on health/resource values.
* Loot & Reward Authority : Server grants loot; duplication and race conditions handled server-side.
* Combat Timers / Phase Changes : Boss phases are server-driven and broadcast with timestamps and sequence numbers for client sync.

---

	11. Security, Validation & Anti-Cheat

	Server-side validation is vital:

* Action Validation : Check client intent vs server rules (movement speed caps, skill ranges, consumable availability).
* Anti-Tampering : Reject impossible states and flag suspicious clients.
* Rate Limiting : Prevent spammed actions or event injection.
* Authoritative Decision Logging : Keep logs for postmortem analysis and rollback if necessary.

---

	12. Fault Tolerance & Recovery

* Snapshot Resync : Clients may request full snapshots when desynced. Use `SnapshotRequest/Reply`.
* Entity State Reconciliation : Graceful interpolation to correct mispredictions.
* Persistent State Storage : Save persistent world state (rare spawn cooldowns, boss defeat flags) to DB; NRL reads/writes to persistence layer.
* Graceful Disconnect : Support disconnect/resume tokens for players re-entering after a disconnect.

---

	13. Cross-Shard & Cross-Region Messaging

	For larger worlds:

* Gateway Nodes : Route messages between shards for cross-region events (guild war triggers, cross-region bosses).
* Event Bridge Integration : Use Event Bridge to trigger cross-shard events — NRL routes the notifications.
* Interest Expansion : Players may need temporary cross-shard subscriptions (e.g., zone transfer during raid).

---

	14. Developer Tools & Debugging

	Essential visibility tools for networking:

* Replication Visualizer : Show what entities are being sent to a chosen client, with last update timestamps and sizes.
* Bandwidth Profiler : Per-client and global bandwidth metrics.
* Packet Tracer & Log Replayer : Replay recorded network sessions for bug reproduction.
* Simulated Latency / Packet Loss Tester : Reproduce client conditions for testing reconcilers and smoothing logic.

---

	15. Implementation Notes & Tech Stack Suggestions

* Transport : UDP with custom reliability layer (or QUIC), with TCP fallback for admin/large reliable messages if desired.
* Serialization : Use compact schemas — Protobuf / FlatBuffers recommended for production MMOs.
* Authoritative Server : Single source of truth for interactions; consider authoritative zones and stateless gateway patterns.
* Scaling : Use horizontal scaling (zoning), dedicated AI/Combat workers, and pub/sub systems (e.g., Redis, Kafka) for cross-service messaging.
* Language / Frameworks : Depends on stack — C++/Rust/Go for servers, Lua/Python for scripting, JS/Typescript for dev tools UI, etc.

	17. Example Flows

	A. Monster Sees Player

1. AIDL (server) detects player via Awareness.
2. Server updates AI state: `AIStateChange: Investigating -> Alert`.
3. NRL broadcasts `AIStateUpdate` to subscribed clients (nearby players).
4. Clients show monster animation; combat prediction not yet started until server confirms.

	B. Player Attacks Monster

1. Client sends `ActionRequest: Attack` to server.
2. Server validates range, cooldown, and computes combat resolution.
3. Server updates monster HP and emits `CombatEvent` + `EntityStateDelta`.
4. Clients display immediate attack animation via prediction; on receiving authoritative `EntityStateDelta` they reconcile HP and FX.

	C. Rare Spawn Trigger

1. Event Bridge dispatches `RareSpawnTrigger` (server).
2. Server checks NRL for interested clients (near zone) and ensures persistent state logs spawn cooldown.
3. NRL notifies relevant clients: `WorldEventNotify(RareSpawn)`.
4. Clients update UI and optionally play server-coordinated cinematic.

	18. Final Notes

* Phased rollout : Implement minimal NRL features first (transform replication, interest management), then progressively add combat, AI replication, and cross-shard
features.
* Data-driven tuning : Keep replication thresholds and tick rates configurable per zone and entity type.
* Telemetry-first : Instrument everything for post-launch tuning — network is where gameplay quality is most obvious to players.
