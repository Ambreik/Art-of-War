			Submercible Chest
			
	Submercible Chest are similar with "World Chest" but are found only in "Water Platform" sometimes near shore or deep under water.
	This can be located anywhere underwater and are found in "Great Sea" only.
	
	Their cooldown is unknown since are very hard to find one. Seems to be up to 7 per spawn. This chest are spawned only in accessible locations where sometimes 
require special equipment to reach this places.
	Some of them require a higher mastery of "Lockpicking" to be able to open it and when so, drop is usuall high or contain a special item.
