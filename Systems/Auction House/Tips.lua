			Tips
			
	Auctions are a great tool for finding items you might need. These items can get expensive, so be prepared when locating and pricing items at auctions. Auctions 
are also a convenient means of getting rid of excess inventory one might not be able use due to level or class restrictions, or products that you make using your 
professions. The game is set up so that some players get items they don't need while others who do need the items will find them difficult to obtain. An example of 
this is cloth since every player will get more cloth than they'll use for first aid, but tailors need a constant supply. So the auction house is designed to be an 
integral part of the game. Auction house prices reflect, as well as directly influence, the inflation ratio of the economy.

	Whether buying or selling, your most important resource is information. For buyers, you need to know whether the price for an item is a bargain you can't pass 
up or a rip-off you should stay away from. For sellers, you need to set a price low enough for the item to sell quickly, but no lower than that.

	What you can find out directly from the auction house is the current supply of an item and an idea of its 'going rate'. Unfortunately, the action house does not 
display what the item was selling for in the past, so if no items are currently on sale the going rate is more difficult to estimate. If there are few auctions for a
specific item, try looking up similar items as well to get a clearer picture. end 

	What you can't find out directly from the auction house is what is the current demand for an item. For example, you may have an item to sell and, seeing that 
the going rate based on 4 players having the same item for sale for 5000g, you put the item on sale for 4900g feeling confident that youve undercut the competition. 
The problem is that just because there are five people trying to sell the item for 5000g doesn't mean there are any people willing to buy the item for 5000g, as you 
may discover when the item comes back to you 48 hours later. The vast majority of auctions are unsuccessful, so finding the best price which will get your item sold 
in a reasonable time can be very tricky.

		Newbie mistakes
	Before buying from the auction house, first look up the item to see if the item is available from an NPC. In most cases, if an item is sold by an NPC then it 
will be for a fraction of what you'd have to pay for it at the auction house. 
	Similarly, don't try to sell an item on the auction house for less than vendor sell price (VSP), which you can easily find by mousing over the item. To get the 
most money you need to allow for the auction house cut as well, but your time is valuable too and selling to an NPC is easier and more convenient. So it's probably 
not worth your while to sell on the auction house unless you can get at least several times the VSP. In particular, you probably shouldn't accept the default value 
as the initial bid price. end end 
	With very few exceptions, don't bother trying to sell Poor quality items on the auction house. It's called vendor trash because only NPC vendors are willing to 
buy it.Don't flood the market with one item. Try to sell one at the auction house and treat the others like vendor trash. An exception to this is Uncommon or above 
quality equipment since enchanters can turn these items into materials they can use, but lower your price accordingly.

		Tips for selling
	Be careful when you are buying out large amounts of items (i.e., trade goods), and make sure you are not paying full-stack price for a stack that is not full.
Sort the items by unit price (see above) to avoid this issue.
	Look for bargains in the bid price instead of just looking at the buyout price. It may mean waiting for your item but the savings may be worth it. This is 
especially true of a glyph or a recipe, things you don't generally need right away but will be nice to have in the future.
	If the bid price is close to or equal to the buyout price then there's really no point in waiting, so just buy the item out.
	
		Keep in mind
	Remember that the cost of doing business at the auction house is more than just deposits and fees. There is also the time it takes to travel to an auction house,
set up and track auctions and bids, and gather data so you can make informed transactions. The benefits of using the auction house will usually outweigh these costs,
but there are often alternatives.
