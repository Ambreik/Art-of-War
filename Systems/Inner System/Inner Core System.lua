			Inner Core System
			
	Inner Core System is a system designed for high level players with the purpose to strengthen the char in a certain direction.
	All characters up to level 60 can use it but from level 70 can actually start to create pieces of "Soul Beans" and "Soul Core".
	
	Characters above level 70 can go to the Alchemist and activate the quest "How to activate my Inner Core.", this will require them to collect 10x 
"Soul Stone Shards" and return them to the Alchemist that will give the first "Soul Bean (Rough)" in return. After this quest is completed, the player has now 
access to the "Inner Core" Inventory by clicking the button on inventory or "Side Panel" or using the "CTRL + I" key shortcut.

	Also after completing the 1st quest, the character will have access to a daily quest "Improvement of Inner Core", while on this quest, players will drop 
"Soul Stone Shards" as "Alternative Drop", once the player has collected 10 shards, they will automatically transform into "Soul Bean (Rough)" and this can be
done 5 times each day until level 100 where after increases up to 10.
	If you right-click on the "Soul Bean (Rough)", you will get a "Soul Core (Rough)" in a random color : 
*Diamond - WHITE,
