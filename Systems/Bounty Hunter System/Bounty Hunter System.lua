			Bounty & Criminal System Overview  

	The "Bounty & Criminal System" is a dynamic justice system that governs law and order in the game world. It introduces crime mechanics, player-driven bounty 
hunting, and faction-based responses to unlawful actions. This system ensures that criminal activity has meaningful consequences while allowing players to engage in
bounty hunting, law enforcement, or even life as an outlaw.  

	Key Features :   

1. Crime & Criminal Status  
	- Players who commit crimes (e.g., attacking NPCs, excessive player killing, illegal faction activities) are marked as criminals.  
	- Crimes must be witnessed by NPCs or reported by players to take effect.  
	- Criminals receive an "Outlaw" debuff, making them hostile to city guards and visible to bounty hunters.  

2. Bounty Placement & Tracking  
	- Bounties can be placed manually by players through Guardians, Bounty Boards, or certain Tavern Keepers.  
	- The system automatically places bounties for severe offenses (e.g., repeated murders, attacking key NPCs).  
	- A Bounty Board Network allows players to track criminals across regions.  

3. Bounty Hunters & Law Enforcement  
	- Players can choose Bounty Hunter as a third profession, allowing them to claim bounties.  
	- Bounty Hunters receive rewards for capturing or killing criminals.  
	- NPC Guardians actively patrol cities and respond to crimes in real-time.  

4. Criminal Consequences & Escape Mechanics  
	- Criminals can pay off bounties or seek protection from outlaw factions.  
	- Guards attack criminals on sight in faction-controlled areas.  
	- The longer a criminal evades capture, the higher their bounty grows.  
	- Completing major events (e.g., World Boss fights, instances) can clear criminal status.  

5. Dynamic Justice & Economy Influence  
	- High-bounty criminals trigger server-wide alerts, making them public enemies.  
	- Faction merchants increase prices for criminals and offer discounts to bounty hunters.  
	- Outlaw-friendly regions offer black market services for fugitives.

		Section 1: Crime Definition & Criminal Status  

	1.1 What Counts as a Crime? 
	A crime is any action that disrupts public order, harms protected individuals, or violates faction laws. Crimes are categorized based on severity, impacting how
authorities and bounty systems respond.  

	A. Criminal Offenses  
	The following actions trigger a criminal status when witnessed by NPCs (guards, trainers, merchants, etc.) or reported through the system:  

1. Attacking NPCs (except in specific PvP events or designated combat zones).  
2. Killing important faction NPCs (e.g., trainers, quest givers, city leaders, high-ranking merchants).  
3. Taking assassination quests (inside Royal District or Port Smuggler’s Alley, if the NPC target is reported or witnessed by others).  
4. Illegal faction activities (smuggling, spying, sabotage, working for outlaw factions).  
5. Repeated Player-Killing (PK Players)  
	- Killing multiple players in a short time in non-PvP zones.  
	- A bounty is automatically placed if witnessed by Guardians, General Merchants, or Trainers.  
6. Confirmed Outlaws (players with a criminal record linked to outlaw factions can be identified and marked).  

	B. Crime Reporting & Witness System  
	Criminal actions must be seen or reported for the system to apply penalties:  
- NPC Witnessing – If a Guardian NPC, Trainer, or Merchant sees the crime, it triggers an instant bounty.  
- System Reporting – If an assassination is detected in a guarded zone, the system logs and broadcasts the crime, adding the player to the bounty list.  
- Player Reports (optional, to be expanded later if necessary) – Players who witness crimes can report the criminal at a Guard NPC or Bounty Board to escalate the 
situation.  

---

	1.2 Criminal Status: "Outlaw" Debuff  
	When a player commits a crime, they receive the "Outlaw" debuff, marking them as a wanted criminal.  

	A. Outlaw Debuff Mechanics  
- Duration : Lasts 10–30 minutes, depending on crime severity. For major crimes, it can last several hours or until caught.  
- City Guard Response : Guards attack on sight if the criminal enters protected zones (cities, faction strongholds).  
- Bounty Hunters Activation : NPC and player Bounty Hunters can actively track and capture them.  
- Visible Criminal Status : Other players can see the Outlaw status, enabling social reactions (chasing, hiding, helping criminals, or aiding law enforcement).  
- Escape Methods : Criminals can attempt to:  
	- Bribe specific NPCs (certain rogue officials may remove bounties for a high price). 
	- Flee to outlaw regions (seeking protection from outlaw factions).  

	B. Ending the Outlaw Status  
	The "Outlaw" status is removed if:  
- The player is captured or killed by a Bounty Hunter or Guard.  
- The player completes a major quest, such as:  
	- Global quest completion  
	- Defeating a World Boss  
	- Completing a major instance or RUN  

---

	1.3 Consequences of Being a Criminal  
	Criminals face various penalties based on their actions:  

	A. Exile System  
	Instead of jailing criminals, they are forcibly exiled from the city.  
- Instant Teleportation outside the city gates after capture.  
- Movement Speed Reduction and a temporary stamina penalty (prevents instant return).  
- Increased hostility from Guards and Bounty Hunters if they try to re-enter too soon.  

	B. Gold Penalty & Debt System  
- Criminals must pay a fine based on their crimes.  
- If they have negative gold, they must work off their debt through:  
	- Faction quests (doing legal work for redemption).  
	- Illegal jobs (working for black market vendors to repay debt in outlaw-controlled areas).  
- Unpaid crimes increase bounty fines, leading to higher penalties for repeat offenders.  
- Bounty doesnt go away but is constantly increases with 5 Silver per hour until one of the few conditions that remove the status of a criminal is accomplished.

	C. Criminal Reputation System  
- Repeated crimes lock players out of major city services.  
- Certain factions deny access to high-level quests or districts (e.g., Royal District, Military District).  
- Criminals must rely on black market vendors for gear, potions, and repairs.  
- Outlaw faction will approve of criminal actions, offering special quests, items, and services.  

	D. Leaderboard for Criminals  
- A leaderboard tracks the most wanted criminals.  
- The longest-surviving outlaws without being caught gain notoriety & possible outlaw faction rewards.  
- All crimes remain recorded, adding to a permanent criminal history that NPCs and bounty hunters can reference.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		Section 2: Bounty Triggers & Placement  

	This section defines how bounties are placed, who can place them, and under what circumstances they are automatically applied.  

---  

	A. Manual Bounty Placement  

	Players can manually place bounties through specific NPCs, ensuring that bounties are legitimate and not used for random personal revenge.  

	1. Where Can Players Place Bounties?  
- Guardians – The main enforcers of the law. Players can report crimes and place bounties against criminals.  
- Bounty Boards – Found in major cities and settlements, allowing players to view only active ones.  
- Tavern Keepers (Certain Ones) – Some shady taverns allow under-the-table bounty requests for a fee.  
- Bounty Hunter Guilds – Players part of a bounty hunter guild (to be created in Outland Territories) can submit personal targets for guild approval.  

	2. Requirements for Placing a Bounty  
- The player must pay a minimum fee (up to 12 Gold) to place a bounty on a target.  
- The system will match the bounty with an additional reward based on the criminal's activity.  
- The target must have committed valid offenses (bounties cannot be placed randomly, e.g., for a single PvP kill unless it was repeated in a short period).  

---

	B. Automatic Bounty Triggers  

	The system automatically applies bounties when a player repeatedly commits crimes.  

	1. Crime-Based Automatic Bounties  
- Multiple player killings in a short time frame, but only if seen by NPCs (e.g., Guardians, General Merchants, Trainers, Skill Trainers).  
- Attacking or killing important NPCs (e.g., merchants, trainers, quest givers).  
- Disrupting public order, such as:  
	- Destroying objects (e.g., city crates, market stalls).  
	- Triggering city alarms.  
	- Fighting near key locations (e.g., inside towns or faction-controlled areas).  
- Evading capture multiple times.  

	2. Guardian Witnessing the Crime  
- If a Guardian NPC directly sees a crime, they instantly apply a bounty.  
- The severity of the crime determines the bounty amount.  
- Fleeing while being chased by a Guardian increases the bounty over time. 
- Continuing being a trouble maker, will automatically increase the bounty, adding every new crime on top of the original amount with 20Silver per.

---

	C. System-Triggered Global Alerts  

	When a player reaches a certain bounty threshold, a server-wide alert is triggered, making them a high-priority target.  

	1. How Global Alerts Work  
- The player’s name is added to every bounty board in Major Cities and nearby settlements.  
- A server-wide message announces the target’s last known location.  
- All active Bounty Hunters receive a private message (PM) with the criminal’s last recorded position.  
- In extreme cases, the criminal becomes a World Event, meaning faction-controlled NPCs will actively try to capture or kill them.  

	2. 
1. Faction-Specific Bounties :  
	- If a Knight Faction player kills Pindar NPCs, it will not automatically trigger a bounty for Dendera faction or Outland Territories continent same the other 
way around.  
	- This is because Knights and Pindars are opposing factions, and engaging in PvP or attacking enemy NPCs is part of faction warfare, which grants REP and PvP 
Points rather than criminal status.  
	- However, within the Pindar Faction, a bounty will be automatically triggered on the Knight player who attacked their NPCs.  
	- This bounty is exclusive to Pindar players, meaning only they can accept the bounty to take down the Knight intruder and claim the reward.  
	- This works for pindars doing those things, in Dendera faction also.
	
2. Outland Territories - Inter-Faction Bounty System :  
	- In the "Outland Territories", where factions coexist, the bounty system functions differently.  
	- Faction-based rules do not apply here, meaning that if a player from any faction kills an NPC, they will be marked for a bounty, regardless of their 
affiliation.  
   - The bounty will work as part of the normal system, and any bounty hunter can take it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		Section 3: Bounty Price Scaling

	This section outlines how bounty prices are determined, the factors that influence the price, and how the system calculates the scaling for different levels of 
crime, evasion, and bounty hunting.  

---

	A. Initial Bounty Placement  

	1. Base Bounty Payment  
	When a player places a bounty on a target, they must pay a base fee, depending on the severity and nature of the crime committed.  
- The base price of a bounty ranges from 3 Gold to 12 Gold, depending on the crime, being pointed out as a recommendation from system.  
- 3 Gold is the minimum for low-level offenses (e.g., minor theft or a single player killing).  
- 12 Gold is the maximum for severe crimes (e.g., multiple murders, attacking high-value NPCs).  

	2. Crime Severity & Scaling  
	The more severe the crime, the higher the base price will be. This allows for dynamic bounties based on the target's actions. Example scales include:  
- Minor Crimes (e.g., petty theft, small fights): 3 Gold.  
- Medium Crimes (e.g., killing NPCs, multiple PvP kills in a short period): 6-9 Gold.  
- Severe Crimes (e.g., murdering important NPCs, mass player killings, damaging critical infrastructure): 10-12 Gold.  

---

	B. Evasion & Delay Fees

	Once a bounty has been placed, the price doesn’t stop there. The longer the criminal evades capture, the higher the bounty becomes due to a delay fee. This fee 
scales with the time that the target avoids being brought to justice.  

	1. Evasion Penalty Calculation  
- 5 Silver is added to the bounty for every hour the target remains uncaught.  
- The evasion fee is cumulative; each hour adds more to the bounty until the target is captured or the criminal satisfy one of the few circumstances that must be 
accomplished.  
- The fee continues to accumulate until:  
	- The criminal is caught by a Bounty Hunter or Guardian.  
	- The criminal successfully completes a global quest, defeats a World Boss, or finishes an Instance or Run.  
	- The bounty reaches a maximum cap (this cap can be up to 300G in some circumstances such, player is a max level or a HERO player).  

---

	C. Stacked Bounties

	If a player has multiple bounties placed on them, the system will stack the bounties together. Each new bounty will be added on top of the existing ones, 
increasing the total bounty amount.  

	1. Stacked Bounty Example  
- If Player X has 3 bounties (e.g., 6 Gold, 8 Gold, and 10 Gold) placed for various crimes, the total bounty would be 24 Gold (6+8+10).  
- If Player X evades capture, the evasion fee (5 Silver per hour) applies to the total bounty, not to each individual bounty.  

---

	D. Paying Off a Bounty

	Players with a bounty on their head can pay off their bounty to avoid the negative consequences associated with being caught. The process allows for a temporary
resolution without facing capture.  

	1. Locations to Pay Off a Bounty  
	Players can pay off their bounties at:  
- Guardians : Found in towns, cities, and major settlements.  
- Bounty Hunter Guilds : A central location where bounties can be resolved, often requiring a small processing fee.  

	2. Payment Terms  
- A player must pay the total bounty (base fee + evasion fees) to have their name removed from all bounty boards and escape the associated penalties.  
- In some cases, the payment must be made before interacting with certain NPCs (e.g., trainers, merchants, or quest givers). If the player refuses to pay, they are 
denied services until the bounty is cleared.  

---

	E. Special Bounty Cases

	There are certain situations where the bounty price may be altered or adjusted, depending on specific circumstances.  

	1. Multiple Crimes Committed Simultaneously  
	If a player commits multiple crimes at the same time (e.g., mass player killings and NPC murder), the system may apply a multiplier to the bounty. This 
multiplier can increase the bounty price by a set percentage (e.g., 1.5x or 2x).  

	2. Exemptions or Discounts  
- Guild Discounts : Members of specific factions or guilds (e.g., Bounty Hunter Guild, Outlaw Faction) might receive a discount on paying off their bounty.  
- Global Quests or Boss Fights : Players who are in the middle of world events, dungeon runs, or world boss fights may have their bounty temporarily frozen or cut 
off if they are actively participating in critical story events.  end 

---

	Summary of Bounty Price Scaling

- Base Fee : 3-12 Gold (depending on the crime).  
- Evasion Fee : 5 Silver per hour until the criminal is caught or special conditions are met.  
- Stacking Bounties : Multiple bounties increase the total bounty amount.  
- Payment Options : Players can pay their bounties at Guardians or Bounty Hunter Guilds.  
- Special Cases : Multi-crime multipliers and guild discounts.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Section 4: Criminal Response Mechanics

	This section focuses on how criminals can evade capture, the mechanics surrounding criminal actions, and how they interact with the world. It outlines the 
methods available for criminals to stay hidden, the factions and NPCs that help them, and the penalties for getting caught.

---

	A. Evading Capture

	Once a bounty is placed on a player, they are now a criminal and can be hunted by Bounty Hunters, Guardians, or other enforcers. To avoid being caught, 
criminals must make use of different evasion strategies. The key methods of evading capture include Smuggling, Faction Support, and Allied NPCs.  

	1. Smuggling NPCs & Hidden Routes  
	Criminals have the option to rely on smuggling routes to avoid capture by Guardians or Bounty Hunters. These routes are often hidden in the world and are 
controlled by Smuggling NPCs—special characters who operate in the shadows.  

- Smuggling NPCs can be found in various locations, typically in secluded, hard-to-find areas, such as underground tunnels, caves, or hidden rooms in taverns.  
- Smuggling NPCs offer safe passage for criminals trying to leave a city or hide within a different region, at the cost of payment or completing a task.  
- Smuggling Routes : These are secret pathways that lead players to less-patrolled areas, helping them avoid Guardians and Bounty Hunters. Routes often go through 
back of the walls of cities or towns, abandoned areas or sectors, or forests that are difficult to navigate or heavily guarded.  

	2. Using Smuggling Routes  
- Criminals can use Smuggling Routes to escape their immediate area or bypass certain regions. Once a route is taken, the system will randomly spawn a location for the criminal to travel to, which may offer temporary safety.  
- If successful, the criminal can move into new regions where they are not wanted, though they risk encountering new bounty hunters or guards in those areas.  
- If the smuggling attempt fails (e.g., caught by guards), the bounty will increase with additional evasion fees.  

---

	B. Faction Support: The Outlaw Faction  

	Criminals can seek refuge in the Outlaw Faction, a specialized faction built for outlaws and criminals. Being part of the Outlaw Faction grants criminals access
to safe havens where they can avoid bounty hunting efforts such "Abalan" region that is a secluded location and very hard to reach it unless you are an outlaw.  

	1. Outlaw Faction Mechanics  
- Faction Membership : Criminal players can join the Outlaw Faction, which is specifically designed to offer protection to those who commit crimes. Membership 
provides numerous advantages, such as access to special resources, safe houses, and black-market dealings.  
- Safe Havens : Certain areas controlled by the Outlaw Faction are considered safe zones where bounty hunters cannot enter. These zones are typically far from major
cities and difficult to find unless a player has specific faction knowledge.  
- Faction Quests : Outlaws can take part in quests related to the faction, earning rewards like better smuggling routes, reputation, or immunity in certain regions.

	2. Outlaw Faction Protection  
- While in Outlaw Faction territory, criminals can freely trade, repair gear, and regroup without fear of being caught.  
- Criminals who are part of the Outlaw Faction can infiltrate certain NPC groups or gain temporary alliances with outlaws, which allows for more effective evasion. 
- Outlaw Faction Leaders : These powerful NPCs provide protection to members but will expect favors or services in return.  

---

	C. Guardian & Baron Support

	In certain situations, Guardians or Barons can be involved in aiding criminals, especially if they are in the midst of some high-profile criminal activity.  
	Guardians and Barons are a helper that players can obtain and help them as a side assitant, those have unique features such skills,equipments and so on.
	
	1. Guardians  
- Guardians are assitants for knights players only. 

	2. Barons  
- Barons are powerful figures who are assistants for pindar faction players. Have same mechanics and systems assigned to them. 

---

	D. Penalties for Getting Caught

	If a criminal is caught by Bounty Hunters or Guardians, they face several penalties, depending on the severity of the crime, their previous evasion, and the 
current bounty placed on them. The penalties can include:

1. Loss of Services  
- Players who are caught with an active bounty may lose access to essential NPC services, such as:  
	- Profession trainers.  
	- Merchants or vendors for item repairs or purchases.  
	- Quest-givers and certain story-driven NPCs.  
	- Lose their title as "HERO" if they own it.
	
---

	Summary of Criminal Response Mechanics

- Evading Capture : Use Smuggling NPCs, routes, and Outlaw Faction services to avoid being caught.  
- Faction Support : The Outlaw Faction offers protection and safe zones, including quests and smuggling routes.  
- Guardian & Baron Support : Guardians or Barons help them in a combat with bounty hunter players. 
- Penalties : If caught, criminals may face loss of NPC services and restriction from entering in major settlements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Section 5: Bounty Hunter Activation Costs

	This section defines how Bounty Hunters interact with the bounty system, the costs associated with their role, and the rewards they receive once they 
successfully catch a criminal. Bounty Hunters, as a third profession chosen by players, have the opportunity to earn rewards for their efforts, but the system 
ensures that they are compensated based on their work and the risks involved in capturing criminals.

---

	A. Bounty Hunter Role Overview

	As a "Bounty Hunter", players take on the task of pursuing criminals with bounties placed upon them. When a criminal is identified and their bounty is active, 
Bounty Hunters can claim the bounty by successfully capturing or killing the criminal. This system outlines how Bounty Hunters earn their rewards, how they handle 
the costs associated with their role, and the different types of bounties that they may face.

---

	B. Activation Costs for Bounty Hunters

	When a Bounty Hunter accepts a bounty, they will need to consider several factors that impact their pursuit cost. This includes the distance to the 
criminal’s location, the time spent tracking them, and any smuggling routes or safe zones the criminal might be using to evade capture. 

	1. Initial Cost  
	The initiaal cost for a Bounty Hunter to begin pursuing a criminal is determined by several factors:

- Base Activation Fee : This is a fixed cost that the Bounty Hunter will receive when they successfully caught the criminal. It includes the administrative costs of
accepting the bounty, the risk involved in taking on the criminal, and any costs associated with gathering intelligence.
- Location-Based Modifiers : The further the criminal is from a Bounty Hunter’s current location, the higher the cost will be. If the criminal is located in a 
remote or hard-to-reach area (e.g., an Outlaw Faction territory, or a dungeon), the Bounty Hunter will need to pay extra for the travel and supplies required to 
reach that area.
	- Remote Locations : Travel to the last location of a criminal,can involve some spendings.
	- Hard-to-Reach Areas : If a criminal is hiding in places like hidden caves, dungeons, or protected safe zones.

	2. Tracking & Intelligence Costs  
	Before accepting a bounty, Bounty Hunters can opt to gather intelligence on the target. The cost of intelligence gathering is also determined by the following:

- Information Gathering : Bounty Hunters may need to pay NPCs (such as Tavern Keepers, Guild Members, or local informants) for information about the criminal’s 
whereabouts or behavior. This will cost a small fee, typically between 5 Silver to 50 Silver per piece of information.
	- Players can choose to gather more detailed information for a higher fee, or simply gather basic details to reduce the cost.

- Tracking Equipment : Special items or tools may be required to track down a criminal. These items can be bought from specialized vendors (e.g., Tracker NPCs) or
acquired through quest lines.

---

	C. Bounty Hunter Rewards

	Once a Bounty Hunter successfully apprehends or kills a criminal, they are rewarded with the bounty placed on the criminal’s head. However, additional bonuses 
and rewards may be offered based on the following:

	1. Base Reward  
	The base reward is determined by the initial bounty placed on the criminal.This amount is the same as the original fee paid by the player who placed the bounty,
which covers the criminal’s capture.

- If the bounty was placed by a player, the Bounty Hunter receives the entire bounty amount directly. 
- If the bounty was system-generated due to repeated crimes, the amount will depend on the severity of the criminal’s actions.

	2. Delayed Reward Penalty  
	If a criminal avoids capture for an extended period, the amount of the bounty increases. Bounty Hunters can still claim this amount as part of their reward, but
a portion of the bounty will be allocated to the authorities (e.g., Guardians or local law enforcement). This additional amount reflects the time the criminal has 
spent evading capture.

- For each hour that the criminal avoids capture, 5 silver is added to the reward, which will be split between the Bounty Hunter and the authorities based on the 
capture time.
	- Example : If a criminal has a base bounty of 10G and evades capture for 5 hours, the bounty increases by 25 silver (5 silver per hour). This additional amount
would be split between the Bounty Hunter and authorities.

	3. Rewards for Special Bounties  
	If the criminal has a special status, such as being a notorious outlaw, world boss, or event-related criminal, the Bounty Hunter may receive:

- Increased Rewards : Special bounties often come with higher rewards due to the difficult nature of capturing such targets.
	- For example, capturing a World Boss might reward the Bounty Hunter with a rare item, extra gear, or an event-exclusive reward.
- Additional Bonuses : These can include access to special vendor discounts, temporary influence in certain regions, or even reputation bonuses with specific 
factions or groups.

	4. Post-Capture Rewards  
	After capturing the criminal, the Bounty Hunter may also receive additional bonuses :

- Faction Reputation : Successfully capturing criminals improves the Bounty Hunter' reputation with law enforcement factions such as Guardians or local authorities.
- Merchant Discounts : A captured criminal's bounty can be used to lower the Bounty Hunter’s costs for repairs or purchases from vendors in the area where the 
bounty was placed. This is because authorities use the captured bounty to fund local economies or reward Bounty Hunters for their service, but also all other 
players can benefit from this discount, in the place where the initial bounty was placed and the criminal was caught.
- "Great hand of a Bounty" : is a buff that a bounty hunter receive upon caughting a criminal or killing one.

---

	D. Costs and Risks of Being a Bounty Hunter

	While the rewards can be substantial, Bounty Hunters face the following risks and costs in their role:

	1. Risk of Failure  
	If a Bounty Hunter fails to capture a criminal or the criminal escapes during an encounter, the activation cost (base fee, tracking costs, and any additional expenses) will be lost. Failure to successfully complete a bounty also results in reputation penalties with certain factions.

	2. Dangerous Encounters  
	Some criminals are highly dangerous, with specialized abilities, powerful items, or the backing of factions. In these cases, Bounty Hunters may face extreme 
danger during the pursuit, risking their health, gear, and reputation. The more notorious a criminal is, the greater the risk and the higher the rewards.

---

	Summary of Bounty Hunter Initial Costs

- Location-Based Modifiers : Additional fees based on the criminal’s location and accessibility.
- Tracking & Intelligence : Optional costs for gathering information and using tracking tools.
- Rewards : Bounty Hunters receive the full base bounty and can earn bonuses for delayed rewards, special bounties, and post-capture bonuses.
- Risks : The risks of failure, dangerous encounters, and potential costs of missing or losing the target.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Section 6: Global Bounty Alerts

	This section focuses on how global bounty alerts work within the bounty system. These alerts are a mechanism to notify players about active criminals with 
bounties on their heads. They help create a dynamic world where criminals and bounty hunters can engage in real-time interactions, making the pursuit of justice 
(or the evasion of it) a more immersive and exciting experience.

---

	A. Introduction to Global Bounty Alerts

	A Global Bounty Alert is a system that broadcasts high-profile criminal activities and the resulting bounties across the game world. When a significant criminal
act occurs or a notorious player accumulates a bounty, the alert is broadcasted, creating opportunities for both bounty hunters and criminals to engage in world 
events and actions. 
	These alerts ensure that the criminal activity does not go unnoticed and that the world reacts dynamically to lawless behavior. It also provides bounty hunters 
with the information they need to pursue these criminals across the game’s regions.

---

	B. Types of Global Bounty Alerts
	There are several types of Global Bounty Alerts, each with different characteristics, based on the criminal’s actions, status, or notoriety:

	1. Criminal Act Alerts  
	Whenever a player commits a significant criminal act (e.g., theft, murder, betrayal), an alert is sent to all players in the region or even globally. These are 
usually low-level alerts that notify players about common crimes that could lead to smaller bounties.

- Example : "A murder has taken place in the town of Riverton. A bounty has been placed on the criminal’s head, worth 5G."
- These alerts may also notify the local authorities or guilds to take action and help combat the crime.

	2. Notorious Criminal Alerts  
	Criminals who have committed multiple high-level crimes or are famous outlaws may trigger a Notorious Criminal Alert. This kind of alert informs the entire 
region or even a global audience that a criminal has become a high-profile target with a significant bounty.

- Example : "Vexor the Deserter has been causing chaos across the kingdom. His bounty is now at 50G, and he is wanted alive or dead."
- Notorious criminal alerts can lead to players from multiple regions pursuing the target and higher competition among bounty hunters.

	3. Faction-Linked Alerts  
	Certain criminal acts or bounties may be specifically tied to factions. If a criminal acts against a faction, their bounty can be escalated and tied to faction-
specific missions or alerts. This kind of alert has an added layer of involvement for the criminal or bounty hunter, as it will affect the faction’s power dynamics.

- Example : "The Thieves’ Guild has been betrayed. A bounty is now placed on the traitor, and all members of the guild are encouraged to take action."
- These faction-specific alerts can also trigger guild vs. guild or faction vs. faction conflicts, adding an extra level of challenge.

	4. World Event Criminal Alerts  
	In special circumstances, a world event may involve a criminal action of great significance, such as the theft of a relic, the assassination of a world leader, 
or the release of dangerous magical creatures. These events can lead to global bounties, affecting the entire game world.

- Example : "The Dragon’s Heart has been stolen by the infamous sorcerer Jaldur. A global bounty is placed on his head for 100G, and the thief is believed to be hiding somewhere in the West."

	These alerts can tie into major storylines or events, creating a long-lasting impact on the game world.

	C. How Global Bounty Alerts Work

	1. Display and Notification System  
	Global Bounty Alerts are displayed in various places across the game interface. These can include:

- Quest Logs : Players can see active bounties on their quest logs if they are participating in related quests or are hired as bounty hunters.
- Public Notices : Certain town boards, guild halls, or public squares can feature bounties and criminal activity, alerting players within the region.
- Global Event Announcements : Large-scale alerts can appear on the main screen as scrolling text or pop-up windows when an event occurs, alerting all players 
globally.

	These alerts are designed to be attention-grabbing and allow players to take action immediately. They may include:

- The criminal’s name (or alias).
- The bounty amount.
- A brief description of the crime or event.
- A location or general area where the criminal was last seen or is believed to be hiding.

	2. Targeting and Interaction  
	Once a Global Bounty Alert is sent, it becomes available to all players in the affected area, including bounty hunters. However, not all players will actively 
pursue the criminal. Those who choose to can accept the bounty through a Guild or Bounty Hunters’ Guild interface.

- Tracking : If the criminal’s location is known, players can head directly to the area and attempt to locate and capture them. The bounty hunter’s guild might also
provide additional clues or tools to aid in this.
- Event-Specific Tasks : In case of world events, additional tasks or quests can appear that offer extra rewards for players who engage in the bounty-hunting 
activity during the event.

	3. Interaction with Criminals  
	For criminals, the Global Bounty Alerts act as a way for them to hide, flee, or defend themselves. They may have to resort to using smuggling routes, outlaw 
factions, or other methods to evade capture.

- Criminals who have been exposed in the alert are usually given an escape window (e.g., a time limit before their capture becomes impossible, or the bounty doubles after a certain point).
- Some criminals may choose to hide in safe zones or smuggling routes, avoiding contact with bounty hunters.

	4. Risk of Escalation  
	If a criminal successfully evades capture for an extended period, the bounty can increase exponentially, triggering higher-level alerts across different regions
or world events.

---

	D. Benefits of Global Bounty Alerts

	1. Bounty Hunter Motivation  
	Global Bounty Alerts offer an exciting way to motivate Bounty Hunters to act swiftly and decisively.With the stakes raised and rewards enhanced by these alerts,
bounty hunters are encouraged to engage in world events, riskier pursuits, and even PvP competition to claim their rewards.

	2. Player Engagement  
	For regular players, Global Bounty Alerts add a new level of excitement and engagement with the world. Players may come across these alerts in public spaces, 
giving them the opportunity to get involved, form alliances, or seek revenge against criminals who have wronged them.

	3. Dynamic World Reactions  
	The constant presence of criminal alerts and bounties adds a level of dynamic interaction to the world. Faction loyalty, criminal activity, and bounty hunter 
alliances can shift, creating ever-changing opportunities for players to engage in global events and alter the state of the game world.

---

	Summary of Global Bounty Alerts

- Types of Alerts : Criminal Act, Notorious Criminal, Faction-Linked, and World Event Criminal Alerts.
- Notification System : Alerts are displayed in the Quest Log only for Bounty Hunters, Public Notices, and Event Announcements.
- Targeting : Players can accept bounties, track criminals, or participate in event-specific quests.
- Escalation : Criminals who evade capture for long periods will see their bounties increase, triggering higher-level alerts.
- Engagement : Alerts foster increased interaction with the world, encourage player involvement, and add dynamic content.

	Section 7: Criminal Safe Zones

	This section delves into Criminal Safe Zones, regions or areas where criminals can temporarily escape the law and avoid immediate capture by bounty hunters or 
authorities. These zones are essential for creating a balance between criminal activity and justice, offering a strategic component to the gameplay for both 
criminals and bounty hunters.

---

	A. Introduction to Criminal Safe Zones

	A Criminal Safe Zone is a specific area within the game world where players with a bounty on their head can temporarily evade capture without fear of being 
hunted by bounty hunters or law enforcement. These zones allow criminals to hide, recover, or plan their next move without constant pressure from bounty hunters. 
	Criminal Safe Zones also provide strategic advantages to criminals, offering a space where they can interact with others, trade, or plan escapes. For bounty 
hunters, these zones offer opportunities for stakeouts, ambushes, or patrols to catch criminals when they leave.

---

	B. Types of Criminal Safe Zones

	There are several types of Criminal Safe Zones, each with its own characteristics and rules for use. Some are more commonly found in the game world, while 
others may be more secretive or hard to access.

	1. Faction-Based Safe Zones  
	Certain factions have built-in safe zones that protect criminals within their territories. If a criminal is part of a faction or has gained favor with it, they 
can seek refuge in these areas. In these zones, authorities and bounty hunters are unable to enforce the law, making it a temporary safe haven.

- Faction Loyalty : Criminals aligned with a faction can find temporary sanctuary, but they must be careful not to anger other factions, as it can escalate their 
bounty or cause further complications.

	2. Smuggler’s Hideouts  
	Smuggling networks often create hidden safe zones in remote parts of the world. These zones are places where criminals, usually those evading capture, can 
receive help from smuggler NPCs to avoid detection. These zones are typically well-hidden, often in caves, abandoned buildings, or remote forests, and provide 
temporary sanctuary for criminals.

- Smuggler's Protection : These areas are usually protected by smuggler NPCs or rogue factions who can warn criminals about incoming bounty hunters or help them 
flee.

	3. Outlaw Faction Territories  
	The Outlaw Faction provides entire regions where criminals can live without fear of being pursued by bounty hunters or the law. These regions are not officially
recognized by the game's factions, but they offer refuge to those who have turned against the established order.

- Outlaw Support : Criminals who belong to the Outlaw Faction can take advantage of specialized services, such as illegal trade, secret quests, and the ability to 
form alliances with fellow outlaws.

	4. Temporary Safe Houses  
	In major cities or towns, there may be underground safe houses where criminals can rest, heal, or hide. These are often temporary, meaning once a criminal is 
detected, they will need to leave quickly. These safe houses are commonly used in urban environments where criminals are trying to blend into the population and 
avoid detection by bounty hunters.

- Urban Camouflage : Criminals can use these hideouts to disappear into the bustling city life, avoiding the attention of local authorities.

---

	C. Benefits of Criminal Safe Zones

	1. Evading Capture  
	The primary benefit of a Criminal Safe Zone is that criminals can evade bounty hunters and authorities for a limited time. This provides them with the 
opportunity to rest, recover health, and strategize their next move without the constant threat of being hunted.

- Temporary Sanctuary : These zones give criminals breathing room to plan their next escape, use hidden trade routes, or even manipulate the world’s political 
landscape to weaken their enemies.

	2. Strategic Planning  
	Safe zones allow criminals to regroup and plan their next steps. They can coordinate with other criminals, form alliances,or even train for upcoming encounters.
For bounty hunters, these zones create the potential for traps, ambushes, or infiltration missions where they can catch criminals off-guard.

- Planning an Escape : Criminals can organize with other outlaws, build alliances, and even plan heists to further escalate their notoriety and the bounty on their heads.

	3. Hidden Trade  
	Many Criminal Safe Zones come with specialized trade systems where criminals can sell illicit goods, buy weapons, or upgrade their gear. This illegal economy 
can become a lifeline for criminals looking to improve their arsenal or maintain a low profile.

- Black Market Deals : Criminals can access illegal items that may not be available in normal markets, such as rare weapons, magic potions, or forbidden artifacts.

	4. Avoiding Reputation Loss  
	By hiding in safe zones, criminals avoid further damage to their reputation and alignment within the game world. If they continue to stay out of sight and avoid
causing major disruptions, they can reduce their notoriety and eventually lower the bounty on their heads over time.

- Restoring Reputation : Over time, criminals can reduce the public eye on them, especially if they lay low in these zones.

---

	D. Mechanics of Criminal Safe Zones

	1. Entry and Exit  
	To enter a Criminal Safe Zone, criminals typically need to pay a fee to smuggling NPCs, or use specific safe routes known only to certain factions or groups. 
Once inside, criminals are typically safe from bounty hunters for a period of time. However, once they exit, they risk being pursued and captured by bounty hunters.

- Smuggling Fees : Criminals may need to pay smuggling fees to enter or exit these zones, which can vary depending on the danger level of the region.
- Exit Points : Safe zones often have specific exit points where criminals can leave quietly, or they may need to wait for a certain event or time to pass before they can safely exit.

	2. Limitations  
	Criminal Safe Zones are not forever safe. Criminals cannot stay hidden indefinitely. These zones have specific time limits or conditions under which the 
criminals will be discovered or forced to leave:

- Smuggling Fees Over Time : Criminals may be charged a fee for staying within the zone for extended periods.
- Bounty Escalation : The longer a criminal stays within the safe zone without being caught, the higher the bounty may rise, drawing more attention and increasing 
the likelihood of a more aggressive capture effort.

	3. Pursuit Mechanics  
	While criminals are protected in safe zones, bounty hunters can still attempt to infiltrate these areas. If a bounty hunter enters a safe zone, they will be 
marked as a target and may be subject to penaltie, such as being attacked by local NPCs or tracked by other bounty hunters.

- Infiltration Risks : If bounty hunters attempt to enter or stake out these zones, they risk becoming targets of the criminals or the factions protecting the safe 
zones.
- Tracking : Once a criminal leaves a safe zone, they may be tracked by surveillance systems or other bounty hunters, allowing for more dynamic pursuit.

---

	E. Benefits of Criminal Safe Zones for Gameplay

	1. Creating Tension and Drama  
	Criminal Safe Zones add a layer of tension, as criminals must balance the need for rest and recuperation with the risk of being discovered and captured. For 
bounty hunters, the challenge lies in identifying and infiltrating these areas, knowing that the stakes are high.

	2. Worldbuilding and Immersion  
	These zones provide deeper immersion into the world, showing how different factions, NPCs, and smuggling networks contribute to the criminal underworld. They 
also reinforce the idea that criminal behavior impacts the world, and players must interact with it on multiple levels.

	3. Strategic Play for Criminals and Bounty Hunters  
	Both criminals and bounty hunters have to think strategically about how they interact with safe zones. Criminals must plan their movements carefully, while 
bounty hunters need to coordinate their efforts to find and capture criminals hiding in these zones.

---

	Summary of Criminal Safe Zones

- Types : Faction-based, Smuggler’s Hideouts, Outlaw Territories, and Temporary Safe Houses.
- Benefits : Safe from capture, time to plan, hidden trade, and reduced reputation loss.
- Mechanics : Criminals must pay fees, stay for limited times, and face risk once they leave.
- Pursuit : Bounty hunters can infiltrate or stake out these zones, but with risks of being targeted.

	Section 8: Law Enforcement and Reputation

	In this section, we will explore Law Enforcement within the game world and its direct influence on the Reputation system for both criminals and law-abiding 
citizens. Law enforcement plays a critical role in maintaining order and enforcing the law, while Reputation affects player interactions, NPC behavior, and how the 
game world reacts to each player’s actions.

---

	A. Introduction to Law Enforcement and Reputation

	In the game, Law Enforcement refers to both NPC factions (such as guards, sheriffs, or military forces) and the mechanisms they utilize to maintain order. This 
section covers the interactions between law enforcement and players, especially those with criminal activity, as well as how a player’s Reputation is impacted by 
their actions in the world.
	Reputation acts as a moral metric for players, influencing the reactions and interactions they encounter. Criminal actions and association with illegal 
activities will increase a negative reputation, while good deeds and lawful behavior will increase a positive reputation.

---

	B. Types of Law Enforcement

	1. Local Guards and Militia  
	Each region or city in the game has its own set of local guards or militia that enforce the law. These NPCs patrol the area, arrest criminals, and keep an eye 
out for suspicious activity. The reaction of these guards to the player’s behavior is determined by the player’s Reputation in the area and the criminal status on 
their head.

- Patrolling Guards : Patrol routes where guards look for suspicious or criminal activity. If a player is in the area and has a bounty, guards will approach and 
attempt to arrest them.
- Regional Response : In larger towns, cities, and important settlements, there are more specialized forces, such as Captains,who are tasked with maintaining peace.
- Arrest and Detainment : Guards will detain players if they are caught committing crimes. Detainment can result in a jail sentence (in some cases) or a fee for 
release, depending on the severity of the crime.

	2. Factional Law Enforcement  
	Certain factions have their own dedicated law enforcement units that not only patrol their lands but also hunt criminals or enforce faction-specific laws.

- Example : The Empire Guard enforces laws across the Kingdom, while the Outlaw Faction has no formal law enforcement, instead relying on its members to govern 
themselves.
- Faction Influence : Factions will view criminals differently. A criminal who aligns with an outlaw faction may receive sanctuary, while criminals within the reach
of a more lawful faction may face a heightened risk of being pursued and arrested.

---

	C. The Reputation System

	The Reputation system plays a pivotal role in the game, influencing a player’s relationship with NPCs, quests, and faction relations. Reputation is primarily 
shaped by the player’s actions, whether they involve committing crimes, completing quests, or helping others. Reputation is dynamic, meaning it can shift over time 
based on the player's choices.

	1. Positive Reputation  
	Players with a positive reputation are known for their law-abiding behavior, often receiving honorable treatment from NPCs, access to better quests, and 
discounts at certain merchants. These players are typically welcomed by law enforcement and cities, making it easier to interact with the world.

- Examples of Positive Actions :
	- Helping citizens with quests or assisting law enforcement in catching criminals.
	- Completing tasks for factions or organizations that promote lawfulness.
	- Donating to causes that aid the poor or disadvantaged.

	2. Negative Reputation  
	A negative reputation is earned through committing crimes, betraying allies, or disrupting the peace. These players are viewed with suspicion by NPCs and may be
shunned or attacked on sight by guards or law enforcement.A high negative reputation can make it more difficult for criminals to access certain regions or services.

- Examples of Negative Actions :
	- Committing theft, assault, or murder in the streets.
	- Evading capture or fleeing from bounty hunters.
	- Allying with or supporting factions or groups that are notorious for criminal activity.

	3. Reputation Adjustment Mechanisms  
	Reputation is a fluid system, meaning it can shift based on the player’s actions, creating a dynamic system of consequences. Players can improve or decrease 
their reputation through a variety of methods.

- Positive Reputation : Can be raised by performing heroic or selfless acts, contributing to local law enforcement, or aligning with benevolent factions.
- Negative Reputation : Can be reduced through actions such as completing redemption quests, working with law enforcement to catch criminals, or undergoing a 
penance system.
- Neutral Reputation : A player starts with a neutral reputation, and their actions in the game world determine if they lean towards positive or negative reputation
over time.

---

	D. Effects of Reputation on Gameplay

	1. NPC Reactions  
	Reputation affects how NPCs perceive the player. Criminals with a low reputation may be immediately hostile or suspicious, while those with a high reputation 
may be treated as heroes or even gain access to special services.

- High Reputation : Discounts, quests, and loyalty from NPCs. Players may also get invited to special events or given rare rewards**.
- Low Reputation : Bounties, fines, higher chances of being caught by law enforcement, and limited access to services.

	2. Law Enforcement Behavior  
	Law enforcement will react differently to criminals depending on their reputation:

- Positive Reputation : Law enforcement sees the player as an ally and will assist in situations where they are in danger or need help.
- Negative Reputation : Law enforcement will treat the player as a hostile threat and may arrest, fine, or attack them on sight.

	3. Quest and Faction Interactions  
	Players with a negative reputation may be locked out of certain factions or quests, especially those that require a high level of trust or honor. Conversely, 
those with a positive reputation will have access to special quests, rewards, and allies.

- Example : A player with a high Outlaw reputation might be barred from entering the Royal Court but might gain access to underground dealings and rogue factions.

---

	E. Managing Reputation and Law Enforcement

	1. Faction-Specific Reputation  
	Reputation can be faction-specific. For example, being hostile towards the Empire might raise your negative reputation with that faction, but you could still 
maintain a positive reputation with the Outlaws. Criminals may want to balance their actions to maintain favor with specific factions while avoiding others.

	2. Law Enforcement Penalties  
	When caught committing crimes, players may face penalties, including:

- Fine Payments : Players may need to pay a fine based on the severity of their crimes.
- Jail Time : Some crimes result in being thrown into a prison for a set amount of time. During this time, the player can be unable to participate in quests or 
interact with the world.
- Loss of Reputation : Committing crimes often results in a negative reputation penalty, further escalating the player’s criminal status.
- Debuff applied when the criminal was caught.

---

	Summary of Law Enforcement and Reputation

- Law Enforcement : Includes local guards, faction-specific law units, and specialized criminal investigation teams.
- Reputation System : Players have a positive, neutral, or negative reputation, which impacts their relationships with NPCs, quests, and factions.
- Reputation Effects : Positive reputation grants access to better services and NPCs, while negative reputation leads to heightened danger from law enforcement and 
limits on faction interaction.
- Reputation Management : Players can either redeem themselves or deepen their criminal path, making reputation a key factor in shaping the player’s experience in 
the game world.

	Section 9: Bounty Hunter Guilds and Their Influence

	In this section, we will examine the Bounty Hunter Guilds, their structure, influence on gameplay, and how they shape the dynamics of law enforcement and bounty
hunting. These guilds are essential for maintaining the balance between law enforcement, bounty hunters, and criminals, and they introduce a network of 
professionals and organizations that track and capture criminals for rewards.

---

	A. Introduction to Bounty Hunter Guilds

	Bounty Hunter Guilds are organizations or factions that specialize in the capture of criminals, bringing them to justice, and collecting bounties. These guilds 
act as intermediaries between the law enforcement system and players who choose to take on the role of a "Bounty Hunter". They offer both rewards for completed 
bounties and protection to bounty hunters working for them. 
	Bounty Hunter Guilds are critical in creating a structured and reward-driven system for players who enjoy the aspect of chasing down criminals and interacting 
with the justice system of the game world. As players engage with these guilds, they become more deeply entrenched in the balance of law and crime, impacting the 
world in meaningful ways.
	Bounty Hunter Guilds are located in : 
- One in "Capital City"
- One in "Ancient City of Sankis - The Central Hub"
- One in "Berlang Fortress"
- One in "Isle of Jartier"
- One in "Emryn Bay".

---

	B. Structure of Bounty Hunter Guilds

	Bounty Hunter Guilds typically follow a hierarchical structure where each member has a specific role, rank, or influence within the organization. These guilds 
can range from small, independent operations to large, government-backed organizations.

	1. Guild Hierarchy and Ranks

	Bounty Hunter Guilds are organized by a ranking system that allows players to progress as they capture more criminals and complete more bounties. Each rank in 
the guild comes with its own responsibilities, perks, and access to better bounties.

- Apprentice Bounty Hunter : A new member of the guild, often tasked with capturing low-level criminals or gathering information about targets.
- Bounty Hunter : The standard rank for a professional bounty hunter. These members can take on regular bounties and participate in the guild’s operations.
- Master Bounty Hunter : An experienced and well-known hunter who has captured several high-profile criminals. They often have access to special missions and 
higher-value bounties.
- Guild Leader : The highest-ranking member of the guild. They control the operations, set the guidelines for bounty hunting, and manage guild politics. They can 
assign high-profile targets or even call upon guild resources for large-scale operations.
  
	2. Guild Responsibilities and Operations

	The guild operates as a collective network of bounty hunters working together to catch criminals, collect bounties, and maintain order in the world. The main 
activities within the guild include:

- Bounty Listings : Guilds provide members with a list of bounties available for tracking. Each bounty includes a reward and details about the target, such as 
location, crimes committed, and any special requirements.
- Coordination of Efforts : Guilds often collaborate on larger operations, pooling resources and information to capture high-profile criminals who are evading 
capture. They can also offer support services for bounty hunters, such as providing safe houses or equipment for tough hunts.
- Tracking and Intelligence : Guilds maintain detailed databases on known criminals and their activities. Bounty hunters may be required to collect information or 
help with surveillance as part of their bounty hunts.

---

	C. Influence on Law Enforcement

	Bounty Hunter Guilds have a significant impact on the broader law enforcement ecosystem. They complement the work of local law enforcement by tracking and 
capturing criminals who may be difficult for regular guards or authorities to catch.

	1. Law Enforcement Collaboration

	While the bounty hunter guilds operate independently of traditional law enforcement, there are opportunities for collaboration. Guilds and law enforcement can 
work together to capture criminals, share intelligence, and even offer joint rewards for high-profile targets.

- Shared Resources : Law enforcement may rely on bounty hunters to handle the capture of dangerous criminals in exchange for a portion of the bounty.
- Covert Operations : In some cases, bounty hunters may be called upon by local law enforcement for undercover missions or to infiltrate criminal organizations.
- Law Enforcement Oversight : In some regions, a liaison officer from the local law enforcement may supervise bounty hunter activities, ensuring they follow proper 
procedures when capturing criminals.

	2. Conflicts with Law Enforcement

	Not all interactions between law enforcement and bounty hunters are friendly. As bounty hunters work in an unregulated environment, there are occasions when 
conflicts arise, especially when bounty hunters operate in a heavy-handed or violent manner.

- Unlawful Hunting : Bounty hunters who overstep their bounds or fail to follow the law can face repercussions from law enforcement, such as fines, imprisonment, or
 being branded as outlaws themselves.
- Underhanded Tactics : Bounty hunters may sometimes resort to coercion, bribery, or extortion to capture criminals. Law enforcement may take action if they feel 
these methods undermine public safety.

---

	D. Impact of Bounty Hunter Guilds on the Economy

	Bounty Hunter Guilds can also influence the economy by introducing a reward-based system that ties directly into the game’s financial ecosystem. Criminals who 
evade capture contribute to a growing reward pool, while bounty hunters benefit financially from their dangerous work.

	1. Bounty Payment System

	When a bounty is placed on a criminal, the guild determines a reward that’s paid to the bounty hunter who successfully captures the target. The value of this 
bounty can increase over time, depending on how long the criminal remains at large. The reward is paid from the guild’s treasury and can vary depending on the 
severity of the crime committed and the urgency of the capture.

- Delayed Payments : If a bounty remains unresolved for too long, the guild may increase the payment to entice more bounty hunters to take on the job.
- Guild Funds : The guild maintains a reserve fund used to pay out bounties. This fund is also used for guild operations, including member recruitment, training 
programs, and equipment procurement.

	2. Market Influence

	Bounty hunters also have an economic impact on the local markets:

- Supplies and Gear : Bounty hunters may need to purchase or repair specific equipment for their missions, such as tracking tools, weapons, and armor. This drives 
demand for specialized items and increases the business for local merchants and craftsmen.
- Recovery of Stolen Goods : When bounty hunters recover stolen items or goods, they may return them to their rightful owners, sometimes receiving a reward from the
victims or from the guild.

---

	E. Role of the Guild Leader and Special Operations

	The Guild Leader plays a significant role in determining the direction and operations of the guild. These leaders can also assign special missions to high-
ranking bounty hunters that might involve larger-scale operations, such as:

- Tracking down high-profile criminals : The guild may assign top bounty hunters to take on criminals who have committed major offenses, such as treason, terrorism,
or assassination.
- Raids on Criminal Organizations : Guild leaders can direct bounty hunters to infiltrate or dismantle major criminal organizations, using bounty hunters’ skills to
disrupt the illegal economy.
- Global Operations : Large-scale bounty hunts may require cross-regional coordination or the involvement of multiple guilds working together to target an 
international criminal network.

---

	F. Guild Benefits for Bounty Hunters

	Bounty Hunter Guilds offer several benefits to players who become members, helping them advance in their role as bounty hunters while enhancing their experience
in the game.

- Training and Skills Development : Guilds provide members with access to specialized training in combat, tracking, and interrogation, helping bounty hunters 
improve their effectiveness and efficiency.
- Guild Headquarters : Bounty hunters can gain access to the guild’s headquarters, a safe haven where they can rest, gather intel, and accept new assignments.
- Guild-Exclusive Gear : Guild members may be given or discounted access to high-quality equipment and gear that is not available to regular players.
- Reputation with Guilds : Players who successfully capture criminals will gain reputation with the guild, unlocking additional rewards, better bounties, and new 
opportunities for high-ranking missions.
