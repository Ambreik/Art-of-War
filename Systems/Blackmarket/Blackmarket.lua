			Blackmarket

	The "Smuggling Cellar" and the "Black Market" within the "Dockworkers' Guild" represent an underground, illicit network where players can engage in hidden and 
high-risk activities. This system adds layers of depth and complexity to the game's economy, allowing players to participate in shadowy dealings, gain rare and 
forbidden items, and climb up the ranks within the guild’s darker side. Here’s a breakdown of the "Smuggling Cellar" and how the "Black Market" operates :

		Smuggling Cellar: Overview 

	Location : Located beneath the Guild Hall, the "Smuggling Cellar" is a dimly lit, secretive space filled with crates, barrels, and shady figures. Only the most 
trusted members of the "Dockworkers' Guild" know about this underground network, and entrance is hidden behind a heavy, locked door or accessible through a secret 
passage.
  
	Theme : The cellar exudes an atmosphere of secrecy, with patrons speaking in hushed tones and transactions taking place out of sight. The walls are lined with 
shelves filled with rare goods, illicit treasures, and contraband items. The air is thick with mystery, and the scent of strange substances lingers in the space.

	Key NPCs : 
  - "Burlin" : The main NPC who introduces players to the "Smuggling Cellar" and its associated activities. "Burlin" is a trusted member of the guild, often seen 
discussing deals with shadowy figures. He is the key figure in accessing the "Black Market" and starting the illicit quests.
  - "Shady Traders" : Various shady traders and merchants who occasionally show up in the cellar, offering rare goods, forbidden knowledge, and unique items in 
exchange for gold or favors.
  - "Guild Lieutenants" : High-ranking members of the "Dockworkers' Guild" who oversee the smuggling operations. These NPCs handle the more significant tasks and 
operations, often offering special quests.

		Black Market System: Mechanics : 

	The "Black Market" offers an entirely new economy and questline based on smuggling, illegal trades, and under-the-table dealings. Here's how it works:

	1. Reputation (REP) System 

	How Reputation Works : 
	- Players can increase their "REP" with the "Dockworkers' Guild" by completing illicit quests and assisting with smuggling operations, such as transporting 
illegal goods or retrieving stolen treasures. The more tasks completed successfully, the higher the player’s reputation becomes within the "Smuggling Cellar" 
network.
	- REP Tiers : The "REP" system consists of several tiers, and players can level up their trust with the "Smuggling Cellar" in the following manner:
		- Tier 1 (New Recruit) : Players start with little to no trust in the "Smuggling Cellar" They can take on simple, low-risk tasks such as moving basic cargo 
		or gathering information.
		- Tier 2 (Trusted Member) : As players complete tasks, they earn trust and move to this tier. They gain access to the "Black Market" and can begin to 
		purchase illicit items and rare materials.
		- Tier 3 (Smuggler’s Elite) : At this level, players are trusted insiders of the "Smuggling Cellar". They can take on more dangerous, high-stakes tasks like
		escorting contraband through hostile territories or engaging in underground dealings with rival factions.
		- Tier 4 (Underworld Boss) : The highest rank, where players gain access to the most dangerous and lucrative quests, high-level black-market goods, and 
		exclusive deals.

	Reputation Gains : 
	- Completing quests for the "Smuggling Cellar" or assisting in dangerous deals will reward players with "REP" points. Successful completion of more complex and 
risky tasks will provide greater "REP" rewards.
	- Negative REP : Failing missions, getting caught by the authorities, or betraying the guild will result in a loss of "REP", potentially blocking further access
to quests or market items.

	2. Trust System 
	How Trust Works : 
	- Trust with specific NPCs in the "Smuggling Cellar" is tracked separately from "REP". Trust represents a player’s standing within the organization and their 
relationship with key NPCs like "Burlin".
	- Building Trust : Players can increase trust by:
		- Consistently completing tasks for the guild and keeping their dealings clean.
		- Helping out NPCs in need or taking on specialized tasks like protecting certain individuals from rival factions or tracking down missing items.
		- Keeping a low profile and avoiding drawing attention from authorities.
	- Special Rewards for High Trust : As trust grows, players can access unique quests, discounted prices on "Black Market" items, and may receive rare, lore-heavy
missions. Certain "NPCs" may even offer personal favors or tips that can assist in the player’s main storyline.

	3. Black Market Transactions 

- What’s for Sale : The "Black Market" offers a range of rare, valuable, and sometimes questionable items that aren’t available through standard guild channels. Items include:
	- "Enchanted Weapons & Armor" : Rare items with special properties, such as weapons that deal additional poison or elemental damage, or armor with hidden resistances.
	- "Forbidden Knowledge" : Scrolls or books that offer forbidden lore, which can unlock special crafting recipes or provide access to unique abilities.
	- "Illegal Potions" : Potions that grant powerful buffs, such as temporary invisibility or enhanced speed, though they may come with dangerous side effects.
	- "Rare Materials" : Hard-to-find crafting materials needed to make high-level gear, often sold at high prices.
	- "Contraband" : Goods that are outlawed or forbidden in certain areas, such as illicit drugs or magical items that are banned in the city. Players can choose 
to sell these goods elsewhere for high profit or deliver them to specific NPCs for a large reward.

- Pricing and Risks :
	- Currency : The primary currency for "Black Market" transactions is "Black Coins", which can only be earned by completing tasks for the "Smuggling Cellar" or 
selling illicit goods obtained from quests. Black Coins hold more value than standard currency, but they’re harder to earn and can’t be used in official guild 
stores.
	- Smuggling Risk : When transporting or using illegal goods, players must avoid detection by guards or rival factions. Getting caught with contraband could 
result in hefty fines, losing "REP", or imprisonment. Higher-tier black-market goods come with greater risk but offer larger rewards.

	4. Secret Quests in the Smuggling Cellar

- Smuggling Missions : Players can be tasked with escorting shipments of contraband, protecting smugglers on dangerous missions, or retrieving stolen artifacts.
	- Escort Missions : Players must deliver illicit goods to distant locations, such as secret hideouts or hidden docks, without being intercepted by guards or rival pirate factions. These missions may involve combat and strategy, as players must choose the safest routes and prepare for ambushes.
	- Treasure Hunts : The guild may send players to recover rare and valuable treasure from wrecked ships or hidden vaults, often requiring the player to navigate dangerous environments or solve puzzles.
	- Heist Operations : Some missions may involve sneaking into guarded facilities, stealing items, and escaping undetected, all while avoiding the law and rival groups. High-level players might be tasked with stealing powerful magical items or rare maps that lead to forgotten ruins.

	5. Consequences of Involvement

- "The Price of Loyalty" : While working within the "Smuggling Cellar" provides high rewards, players must be cautious. Constant dealings with the underground can 
draw the attention of city guards, rival factions, or even powerful enemies in the underworld. Players may face betrayals, sabotage, or attacks from those who seek 
to disrupt the guild’s illicit operations.  
- "Factions and Rivalries" : The guild’s illegal dealings will eventually cross paths with rival pirate factions, competing smuggling rings, or even law enforcement
factions. As players rise in power and gain more influence, they’ll be forced to navigate these complex relationships, making strategic choices to protect their 
interests or eliminate threats.

	By participating in the "Smuggling Cellar" and the "Black Market", players can immerse themselves in an entirely different aspect of the game, one where 
secrecy, danger, and illicit trade govern their actions. This system adds variety to the player’s experience, offering rich rewards, high stakes, and the 
opportunity to shape their reputation within the darker corners of the "Dockworkers' Guild".
