			Mystic Shards System  

	Overview : Mystic Shards are special items that grant permanent bonuses when inserted into weapons or armor. Players can enhance their equipment strategically 
using these shards. The enhancement process involves a bit of risk and customization but remains accessible and straightforward to ensure balanced gameplay.  

	Key Features  
1. Grades & Enhancements  
	- Mystic Shards have grades ranging from +0 to +3, each providing increasing bonuses.
	- Blacksmiths at Rank 2 or higher can attempt to refine "Mystic Shards" into their ultimate form ("Mastercrafted Shards") with a chance of failure.
	- Successful refinement yields a shard with no “+4” in the name but offering significantly boosted effects.
	- "Mastercrafted Shards" cannot stack but offer immense advantages.

2. Inserting Mystic Shards  
	- Equipment must have empty slots for shard insertion.  
		- Level 20 or below : 1 slot  
		- Level 25–40 : 2 slots  
		- Level 45 and above : 3 slots  
		- Level 100 and above : 3 slots, with the 4th slot unlocked by using the "Masterwork Slot Catalyst" (available from the "Legendary Blacksmith").
	- Insertion has a chance to fail, creating a "Broken Shard", which can be removed or cleaned with special items like the "Magic Broom Sweep".

3. Shard Extraction  
	- Use a "Spirit Stone Scroll" to remove all shards, leaving broken marks.  
	- Use "Scroll of Rearrange" to remove the last inserted shard without marks,or "Superior Scroll of Rearrange" to choose any shard for removal with minimal risk.

4. Shards & Stacking  
	- Mystic Shards from +0 to +3 can stack up to 20x, while "Mastercrafted Shards" cannot stack.

5. Uses  
	- Mystic Shards can be inserted into equipment for bonuses or melted into "Refined Ores" for crafting upgrades, but only +0 to +2 can be melted.
	- Each shard can only be applied once to an item; for example, a 'Barrier Shard' can only be used on an armor piece once and cannot be stacked with another of 
the same shard on the same item."

	Additional Improvements  
- Simplified Blacksmith Mechanics : Shard improvement now starts at Blacksmith Rank 2, with refinement results labeled as Mastercrafted instead of “+4.”  
- Enhanced PvP Variety : PvP shards now feature thematic names (e.g., "Hunter's Bane") to make them more immersive and unique.  
- Accessibility : By allowing early refinement, players gain access to higher-quality shards without needing to fully max out Blacksmith Rank.  
- Shard Improvement Process :  
	- All shards can be improved, requiring the target shard and 2x extra shards of the same type.  
	- These extra shards are consumed regardless of success or failure.  
	- E.g., To craft a "Spirit Shard +1", you need "1x Spirit Shard +0" as target intended to upgrade it, and 2x "Spirit Shard +0".
