			Enchantment
			
	Enchantment refers to a permanent stat bonus that can be added to equipment. Only one such enchantment can be active on that item at a time; subsequent 
enchantments will overwrite any existing enchantment. However, temporary imbue effects can be applied which stack with existing enchantment effects. Enchantments 
appear in yellow font near the bottom of equipment descriptions and are written in a style that distinguishes them from standard stats and effects.
	Enchantments provide a variety of effects and can greatly improve gameplay. The cumulative effects of wearing multiple enchanted equipments can potentially exceed
that of any one equipment, i.e., it is like having an extra piece of equipment that does not occupy a slot.
	There are currently no enchantments available for trinkets or slot. There were also never any enchantments available for items equipped in the relic or ammo 
equipment slots.
	Enchantments which come from the enchanting profession require the services of an enchanter. There are also a number of enchant-granting items, or augments, 
available from a number of sources. These augments may be crafted by other professions (Blacksmithing) or obtained from quests or vendors or even drop. There are a 
number of augments that can be purchased from various quartermasters after gaining reputation with their respective factions.
