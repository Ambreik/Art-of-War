			Disenchanting
			
	Disenchanting is the process of transmuting armor or weapons of uncommon, rare, or epic quality into magical elements such as 
*crystals, 
*shards, 
*essences, 
*dusts,
*energy fragment 
	All those magical elemetns can be used to create other items or enchanting recipes. 
	Disenchanting can be done only by an "Alchemist" NPC from level 30, once a character complete the series of mini-chain quests. Once is used, character receive 
<System Message> : "Be aware, this process destroys the target item permanently!"
	Another thing to take it in account is that disenchanting from a full inventory, the disenchanted item will still occupy a space and you won't be able to pick up 
any materials unless you already have a partial stack.
