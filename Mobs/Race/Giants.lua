			Giants
			
	
The  was once a beautiful place of peace and prosperity. It was home to many different cultures and tribes, who lived in harmony with each other and with nature.

But all of this changed when The First Great War began. It was a war between the humans and the forces of an ancient god, Zir. During this war, Zir created two immense legions of giants to fight on his behalf.

The giants were huge humanoid monsters, standing at least seven feet tall and possessing incredible strength and mercy. They were led by their chief, D'hakar, who possessed great abilities and power.

The giants were victorious in the war, and the humans were forced to retreat. As a result, the giants were able to take control of the Anghal Desert and make it their own.

Since then, the giants have ruled the desert, protecting their leader's tomb in the depths of the desert. They are a mysterious and powerful force, and they have kept the peace in the desert for centuries.

Though the giants are powerful, they are also merciful and kind. They have been known to help those in need, and they do not interfere in the affairs of the humans.
