			Dreadjaw, The Hungering Maw  
		World Boss – Devourer of the Deep  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Location : Dreadjaw roams the "Great Sea", lurking beneath the surface near shipwreck sites, deep trenches, and regions with high maritime activity. It is drawn
to bloodshed and large gatherings of prey, often appearing near the Riddleport coast or during battles at sea. Unlike other sea creatures, Dreadjaw hunts in both 
shallow and deep waters, making it an unpredictable and ever-present threat.  
	Dendera Continent : Fanthe'kar : Fierdon : Riddleport

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Description : Dreadjaw is an ancient, colossal shark-like beast, covered in thick,scarred hide that has withstood centuries of battle. Its massive jagged teeth,
arranged in multiple rows, continuously regenerate, ensuring that no prey can escape once caught. Its eyes, dark as the abyss, glow faintly with an eerie 
luminescence, reflecting the horrors of the deep.  
	Dreadjaw's body is covered in remnants of past battles—harpoons, broken ship masts, and rusted anchors lodged into its flesh, each a grim reminder of failed 
attempts to slay it. The water around it is permanently stained with the blood of those it has consumed, forming a haunting red mist as it approaches.  
	Seafarers tell terrifying tales of entire ships disappearing in the blink of an eye, swallowed whole by the "Hungering Maw". Many believe that within its belly 
lie the remains of lost treasures, still guarded by the unfortunate souls who met their end within.

	Mechanics (Monster Characteristics)

1. Terror of the Deep – Dreadjaw moves undetected beneath the waves, only revealing its presence once it begins an attack* giving players limited time to react.  
2. Hunger Unending – Dreadjaw’s primary instinct is to consume anything in its path, including ships, siege weapons, and players. If not actively engaged, it 
targets large objects or groups of players.  
3. Swallowed Whole – Dreadjaw’s most feared ability: It swallows players whole, transporting them to a secondary combat phase inside its stomach. Trapped players 
must fight against digestive acid, parasitic creatures, and the remains of past victims to escape before being dissolved.  
4. Blood Frenzy – When damaged severely, Dreadjaw enters a frenzied state, increasing its attack speed, damage, and aggression.  
5. Doomed Voyage – If a ship is present, Dreadjaw attempts to capsize and consume it entirely, forcing players to either escape or fight for their lives underwater.  
6. Final Stand: The Maw Opens – Upon reaching critical health, Dreadjaw opens its mouth wide, attempting to consume as many enemies as possible in a final rampage
. Players caught in this attack are trapped inside until either they escape or the beast is slain.

	Skills :  

1. Abyssal Charge – Dreadjaw surges forward at blinding speed, ramming through everything in its path, dealing massive physical and water damage.  
2. Razor Bite – A devastating bite attack that ignores armor, dealing true damage to a single target. If the target is below 50% HP, there is a chance to be 
swallowed whole.  
3. Wave of Dread – Dreadjaw thrashes its body, generating a powerful shockwave that knocks back players and capsizes small boats.  
4. Swallow Whole – Dreadjaw selects a group of players and consumes them, sending them to an internal phase where they must fight parasites, acid pools, and 
reanimated corpses to escape.  
5. Digestive Acid Surge – Inside Dreadjaw’s stomach, pools of corrosive acid begin spreading, dealing increasing damage over time. Players must keep moving to avoid
permanent stat debuffs.  
6. Hungering Maw – At critical health, Dreadjaw attempts a final, massive swallow attack, pulling in any remaining players on land, ships, or the battlefield. Those
caught must battle internally or die.  
7. Blood Frenzy – When below 30% HP, Dreadjaw gains 50% attack speed and ignores pain, reducing incoming damage for a short period.  
8. Final Regurgitation – If Dreadjaw is defeated while players are inside its stomach, it violently regurgitates them, launching them across the battlefield with 
residual acid damage over time.
