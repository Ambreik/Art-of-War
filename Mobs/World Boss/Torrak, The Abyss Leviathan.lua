			Torrak, The Abyss Leviathan  
		World Boss – Serpentine Horror of the Deep  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Location : Torrak, The Abyss Leviathan, emerges from the depths of the Great Sea, primarily appearing near the Riddleport coastline during violent ocean
storms. It can be spotted in open waters near shipwreck sites or lurking beneath the waves before its full emergence. The creature is drawn toward turbulent waters 
and electrical disturbances, making its presence unpredictable yet devastating when it strikes.

	Description : A monstrous, ancient sea serpent with a body spanning over a hundred meters in length, Torrak is covered in jagged, obsidian-like scales that 
crackle with bioelectric energy. Its luminescent eyes burn with an eerie blue glow, reflecting the storm’s fury, and its many fin-like appendages surge with raw 
energy. The beast’s roar reverberates through the ocean, sending waves crashing against the shore and striking fear into those who dare oppose it. As it moves, arcs
of lightning dance across its scales, illuminating the abyss from which it came.  

Torrak is said to be a harbinger of destruction, a force of nature that has tormented sailors and coastal settlements for centuries. Legends tell of entire fleets vanishing beneath the waves at the mere sight of its coiled form.

	Mechanics (Monster Characteristics) :  

1. Storm-Bound Awakening – Torrak only emerges during severe storms, drawn to the energy of chaotic weather patterns.  
2. Deep-Sea Terror – While submerged, Torrak cannot be targeted directly. Players must use siege ballistae from ships or Riddleport’s coastal defenses to force it to surface.  
3. Abyssal Presence – Torrak’s very existence causes periodic tidal waves, knocking players off their feet and dealing heavy area-wide damage.  
4. Electric Surge – As its health decreases, its lightning-infused scales intensify, causing attacks to chain to multiple players in proximity.  
5. Phase Transitions – At certain health thresholds, Torrak dives into the sea and re-emerges in a different location, forcing players to reposition.  
6. Territorial Wrath – If left unchecked for too long, Torrak destroys nearby ships and port defenses, affecting trade routes and NPC availability in Riddleport 
until it is defeated.

	Skills :  

1. Abyssal Roar – Torrak lets out a thunderous roar, causing a shockwave that pushes all nearby players back and momentarily stuns lower-level characters.  
2. Leviathan’s Coil – The beast twists its massive body around the battlefield, sweeping through structures and players with crushing force.  
3. Stormcaller’s Wrath – Channels a massive storm surge, striking all enemies in range with lightning bolts that increase in damage based on proximity.  
4. Maelstrom Vortex – Torrak generates a powerful whirlpool, pulling players towards its core while applying drowning effects to those who fail to escape.  
5. Chained Lightning Strike – Targets a single player with a lightning bolt, which then jumps to other nearby players, increasing damage with each jump.  
6. Thunderous Submersion – Torrak dives underwater, becoming untargetable, before resurfacing with an explosion of electrified water, dealing massive AoE damage.  
7. Torrential Surge – Summons giant waves that crash onto the battlefield, washing away unprepared players and dealing water-based damage over time.  
8. Final Wrath: Eye of the Storm – Upon reaching critical health, Torrak summons a powerful hurricane, drastically reducing visibility and increasing the speed of 
all storm-related attacks.
