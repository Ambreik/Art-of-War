			Krala’Thul, The Nightmare Below  
		World Boss – The Abyssal Horror  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Location : Krala’Thul resides in the darkest depths of the ocean, emerging only in regions where the abyss stretches beyond human comprehension. It has been 
sighted near ancient ship graveyards, deep trenches, and uncharted waters, particularly around the "Midnight Chasm"—a bottomless rift where legends say the sea 
itself was born.  
	Unlike other sea creatures, Krala’Thul does not roam. It waits. It lurks beneath the waves, drawn to massive disturbances in the ocean, such as naval battles, 
powerful storms, or concentrated groups of adventurers who unknowingly attract its attention.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Description : Krala’Thul is a titanic kraken-like horror, an ancient entity said to have existed before recorded history. Its body is an abyssal void, its flesh
resembling dark, shifting shadows, as if the ocean itself manifests through its form. Ten colossal tentacles, covered in runic scars and bioluminescent markings, 
emerge from the water, each powerful enough to shatter ships or crush entire squads of warriors.  
	Its massive central body, hidden deep beneath the waves, houses a void-like maw—a swirling vortex of teeth and abyssal energy, capable of swallowing entire 
vessels. Its eyes, scattered across its tentacles, pulse with eldritch light, inducing madness in those who stare too long.  
	Seafarers whisper that Krala’Thul is not merely a beast, but a force—an extension of the ocean’s will, awakened only when the sea hungers.

	Mechanics (Monster Characteristics)  

1. The Abyss Awakens – Krala’Thul does not appear immediately. Instead, the sea darkens, the winds die, and the water becomes unnaturally still. Then, without 
warning, massive tentacles emerge from the depths, signaling its arrival.  
2. Tentacle Dominion – Krala’Thul primarily fights using ten massive tentacles, each acting independently. They crush, grab, or drag players into the depths. 
Tentacles can be temporarily severed**, but they regenerate over time.  
3. Dragged Below – Any player caught by a tentacle grab is pulled into the ocean, forcing them into an underwater survival phase, where they must break free or risk
drowning.  
4. Shipbreaker – Krala’Thul’s tentacles prioritize ships and siege weapons, attempting to destroy them first before focusing on players.  
5. Madness of the Deep – Players who look directly into Krala’Thul’s eldritch eyes for too long suffer from sanity loss, causing hallucinations, debuffs, or loss of
control over their character.  
6. Drowning Nightmare – The battlefield slowly floods with abyssal water, reducing movement speed and visibility. Over time, players without water-breathing effects
will begin to suffocate.  
7. Final Stand: The Maw Opens – When Krala’Thul reaches critical health, its true body rises from the abyss, revealing a massive, gaping maw that attempts to devour
everything in sight, pulling ships, players, and even the surrounding ocean into the void.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Skills :  

1. Abyssal Tentacle Smash – Krala’Thul slams a tentacle down onto a targeted area, dealing massive physical and water damage, knocking back all players.  
2. Grasp of the Deep – A tentacle wraps around a group of players, dragging them into the ocean. If not freed quickly, they are pulled into an underwater phase where they must fight against abyssal parasites.  
3. Tidal Collapse – Krala’Thul summons a massive tidal wave, sweeping players and ships away, disorienting them for a short time.  
4. Eldritch Stare – Krala’Thul’s eyes pulse with abyssal energy, inflicting Sanity Loss on those who look directly at them. Affected players experience hallucinations, random movement, or self-inflicted damage.  
5. The Maw Beckons – At critical health, Krala’Thul rises from the depths, revealing its true form. It opens its void-like maw, pulling everything within range towards it. Any players caught are swallowed and must fight inside the abyss to escape before being consumed.  
6. Drowning Nightmare – The battlefield becomes increasingly submerged, making movement difficult. Players without water-breathing effects start losing health over time.  
7. Final Devour – In a desperate act, Krala’Thul attempts to consume the entire battlefield, dragging ships, debris, and players into the abyss. If not stopped in time, the fight ends with total annihilation.
