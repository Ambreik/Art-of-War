			The Windborne Clan  

---

		Overview :  
	The "Windborne Clan" is a revered faction of elemental mages deeply attuned to the winds and skies, their power linked to the primordial god of 
wind, "Oxogol". Known for their mastery of "Wind Magic" and the ancient "Wind Paths", which are teleportation routes created by the winds, the clan’s 
knowledge is integral to navigating vast distances across the continents. Though the clan's glory once stretched across the land, they now live in 
relative obscurity, having been shattered during the "Second Great War". However, through the efforts of "Telara Windstrider", their legacy is slowly 
being restored as she opens the ancient routes to the public.

		History and Origins

---

	The Primordial Wind God: Oxogol  
Long before the Windborne Clan was formed, the primordial god of wind, "Oxogol", existed. "Oxogol" is the essence of the wind itself, embodying 
freedom, change, and destruction. A being of boundless power, "Oxogol" was one of the first primordial gods to walk the world, shaping the winds and 
skies to their will. However, his thirst for power led him to defy the gods of order, resulting in a great celestial conflict. As punishment, "Oxogol"
was imprisoned in the "Tempest Chamber", located in the deep, forgotten "Nakazamian Castle", where his stormy rage is kept in check by ancient wards.

While imprisoned, "Oxogol's" influence still ripples through the world. The winds that flow across the land are said to be his restless whispers, and 
the "Windborne Clan"—formed much later—was one of the first mortal groups to hear and heed his call. They were granted powers by "Oxogol**'s" essence,
which they honed to control the elemental forces of air and to open magical "Wind Paths" for instantaneous travel across vast distances.

	The Creation of Zephor :  
At some point, a figure known as the "First Windcaller" established a pact with "Oxogol", channeling the primordial god’s power to create "Zephor", an
elemental being crafted from "Oxogol's" will. Zephor became the guiding spirit of the Windborne Clan, representing the winds themselves—both the 
gentle breezes and the destructive storms. Zephor’s guidance allowed the clan to wield wind magic and maintain the sacred "Wind Paths", ensuring the 
safety and prosperity of those who traveled through them.

Though "Zephor" is not as powerful as "Oxogol", their influence is still considerable. Zephor is seen as the wind’s spirit, a being that guides 
travelers and helps maintain the balance of nature. Some believe that, through Zephor, the winds continue to carry "Oxogol’s" will in the world.

	The Winds of War :  
During the "Second Great War", the Windborne Clan’s abilities became both a blessing and a curse. Their control over the "Wind Paths" was sought by 
both sides of the conflict. The winds carried armies and supplies across great distances, but they also became unstable and corrupted by dark forces, 
leading to disastrous consequences. After the war, much of the clan was scattered, and their sacred shrines were destroyed or abandoned. The "Wind Paths" became dangerous and unreliable, and the once-great clan fell into obscurity.

		The Legacy of the Windborne

	Telara Windstrider’s Return :  
In the present day, "Telara Windstrider" has stepped forward as one of the last known heirs of the "Windborne Clan". Taking on the mantle of 
"Windborne Steward", she works to re-establish the "Wind Paths", ensuring their safe use for travelers. "Telara" is dedicated to restoring the clan’s
honor, but she also understands that their ancient ways are fading. The "Wind Paths" are opening once more under her guidance, but many secrets still 
remain lost, and some dangers still lurk within the winds themselves.

		Modern Influence of the Windborne Clan

---

Despite the many centuries of hardship, the "Windborne Clan" still wields significant influence. Their mastery over the "Wind Paths" allows for swift 
travel, enabling them to assist adventurers who seek to explore distant regions like "Zonen" and the "Outland Territories". Though only a few 
Windborne remain, their connection to the ancient elemental power continues to shape the world.  

In the future, the "Windborne" may return to prominence once "Oxogol’s" imprisonment is resolved and the "Tempest Chamber" is unlocked, possibly 
unleashing new powers and challenges. Until then, the clan's scattered members ensure that the winds continue to guide those who seek them, while 
their "Tempest Gateways" provide critical access for those wishing to explore the distant corners of the continent.
