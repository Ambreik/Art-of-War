			Gnol Nation

	The "Gnol Nation" of Targas is a proud, deeply spiritual tribal society with a rich heritage and a fierce independence. Unlike many other indigenous groups 
encountered by Pindar hunters, the Gnols are not merely bands of savage creatures; they are a highly organized society with a complex hierarchy, ancient traditions,
and mystical connections to their land. Recognized for their unwavering loyalty, shamanic power, and territorial dominance, the Gnols are a key aspect of the Targas
ecosystem—and a serious challenge for hunters.

		Origins and Cultural Background

	The Gnols trace their lineage to the ancient spirits of Targas itself. They believe they were born of the land’s own life force, with each clan’s ancestors 
embodying different elements of the natural world. Legends say that in the era of the first sun, the Gnols were granted sacred stewardship of Targas by the god of 
the earth, binding them to the jungles, mountains, and rivers. Their spiritual practices stem from an ancient pact with these elemental forces, and their shaman 
leaders are considered the vessels of these natural powers. 

	Gnols possess unique physical attributes that set them apart: muscular, wolf-like bodies covered in short, dense fur, with sharp, predatory eyes adapted for the
dense jungles and dark forests. Their keen sense of smell and remarkable tracking abilities make them excellent hunters and trackers, and they are known to mimic 
the calls of local wildlife, allowing them to communicate across vast distances in secret.

		Society and Structure

	The Gnol Nation is organized into a federation of clans, each with its distinct hierarchy and specialty. Clans are typically led by chieftains, often the 
strongest warrior or the most experienced shaman. Chieftains hold power through a combination of brute strength, wisdom, and spiritual blessing. The clans share
resources and often come together in times of war, but each retains its autonomy. Shamanic councils, made up of each clan's spiritual leaders, are entrusted with 
maintaining the mystical practices that bind the Gnol society to the land.

1. "Red Fang Clan" : Renowned for their unparalleled tracking skills, the Red Fang Clan occupies the northern regions of Targas and acts as scouts and guardians for
the Gnol Nation. They are skilled in guerrilla tactics and are rarely seen by outsiders until it is too late.

2. "Stonepaw Clan" : Located in the rocky regions near Crescent Mountain, the Stonepaw Clan has a reputation for brute strength. They act as the main defenders of 
the Gnol territory and are known for crafting heavy stone weapons and armor. They guard the peaks of Crescent Mountain, fiercely protecting the pathway to Zen 
Castle and the spiritual altars found there.

3. "Siltide Clan" : This clan is native to the riverbanks and wetland areas, particularly along the Red River. The Siltide Clan is the most shamanic of all clans, 
with a connection to water spirits and an expertise in herb lore. They brew potent potions and poisons, adding a mystical advantage to the Gnol Nation’s defenses.

4. "Duskveil Clan" : Living deep within the Farbus Jungle, the Duskveil Clan is known for its ambush tactics and mastery of the jungle’s shadows. Skilled in 
camouflage and swift attacks, they specialize in capturing intruders for interrogation, viewing themselves as protectors of the jungle’s inner mysteries.

		Beliefs and Rituals

	The Gnols believe that the land and its spirits provide for them but must be respected with utmost reverence. Their shamanic practices revolve around connecting
with these spirits through meditation, ritual dance, and sacred offerings. The spirits, according to Gnol belief, grant visions, guide hunters, and protect their 
clans from external threats. 

	Ritual sites dot the landscape, and each clan has its own sacred grounds, often concealed within the jungles or mountains. It is rumored that the most powerful 
shamanic leaders possess the ability to commune with ancient elemental beings, channeling their powers into devastating spells. The shamans also conduct ceremonies 
for births, deaths, and seasonal transitions, ensuring their bond with the spirits remains unbroken.

	One of the most sacred rituals in Gnol society is the "Calling of the Ancestors", a rite held at the peak of Crescent Mountain during the longest night of the
year. Here, under a star-filled sky, the Gnol shamans summon the spirits of their ancestors, seeking guidance and strength for the challenges ahead. Hunters who 
attempt to approach this ceremony are met with the full wrath of the Gnol Nation, as it is their most sacred and vulnerable moment.

		Conflict with Pindar Hunters

	The arrival of hunters from the Pindar faction has put the Gnols on high alert, and tensions between the two groups are fraught with conflict. The Gnols view 
the hunters as intruders who defile their sacred lands, taking valuable resources without respect for the spirits. Pindar hunters, meanwhile, see the Gnols as a 
source of rare materials for crafting Runes—a resource essential for advancing in the hunter’s profession. 

	This has led to an ongoing war between the two factions, with the Gnols mounting guerrilla ambushes to keep hunters at bay. Skilled in jungle warfare and 
stealth, the Gnols can surprise even the most prepared hunters. Their familiarity with the terrain, combined with their knowledge of mystical barriers, makes them a
daunting foe in the dense jungle landscape.

		Items and Resources of the Gnol Nation

	The Gnols are known to carry rare resources valuable to the Pindar hunters. Their shamanic tools, often infused with elemental magic, are highly sought-after 
for crafting. Hunters who manage to best a Gnol in combat may obtain:

- Spirit Fragments : Mystical remnants of their spiritual rituals, these fragments are used to create powerful Runes.
- Gnol Totems : Sacred carvings blessed by shamans, believed to offer protective powers.Totems are often key components for imbuing Runes with defensive properties.
- Jungle Oils : Collected by the Siltide Clan, these potent herbal concoctions can be crafted into poisons, traps, or even beneficial salves.

		Significance in Targas and the World Game

	The Gnols embody the spirit of Targas as protectors of the land’s integrity, clashing with Pindar hunters who are drawn to the region by their own motivations. 
As a native force, they introduce players to the idea of environmental and spiritual guardianship, pushing players to consider the impact of their actions. Their 
presence not only adds to the lore of Targas but also provides rich storytelling opportunities that deepen the player’s connection to the World Game. 

	Ultimately, the Gnol Nation is a reminder of the World Game’s complexity and the web of cultural, environmental, and magical elements that coexist within its 
regions.
