			Anglers
			
	The Anglers are a faction of fishermen mainly active in the "Capital City" of "Middlean Islands".
	
	The Anglers are a race of people, with ancestors from ancient times who perfected the art of fishing in all areas of the world. They shared this art only with 
their families and it became just a myth this days. Now they can only be found in the "Capital City" or on the "Middlean Islands" when they go on expeditions.
	They are tall, slender and blond people with long hair, some with ponytails or bandannas. Wear a unique uniform, a white t-shirt with a sleeveless armor made of 
dry shark skin, which has properties to block any physical but also magical attack, and gray pants made of the same material. They have a distinctive mark on the back,
like a logo with a silver iron rod in a square with bent corners, on a background that appears to be a wave of flowing waters.
	They are skillable and have an extraordinary attack and movement speed. 
	Carry their fishing rods in their left hand and are always equipped with a fishing kit and sometimes a backpack on their back when they are ready to go to sea.

	Currently, there are only 7 members of this family of fishermen, each specializing in a different style of fishing. At the same time they are Craft and SHOP NPC. 
They can also offer quests sometimes or are involved in different fishing events.
