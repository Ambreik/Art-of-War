			Sub-Chapter 2: The Frigid March

As dawn breaks over Windstorm, the Knights and Pindars gather their ranks, steeling themselves for the journey through the snow-laden expanse leading to Nakazamian Castle. The icy wind cuts sharply, carrying whispers of the Wind God’s presence, as if warning the army of the peril that awaits. Visibility is limited to a mere stretch ahead, with snow drifts creating both obstacles and eerie illusions on the barren, white plain.

The journey is divided into two phases: first, through the snow-heavy highlands and second, across the looming Frozenwall Citadel that guards the outer border of the Wind God’s domain.

**1. Highlands of Snowfall Plains: An Unforgiving Path**

The troops advance into the rugged highlands, a place marked by towering snowdrifts and rocky outcrops coated in ice. Here, the landscape itself becomes an adversary; each step drains stamina, and the bitter chill gnaws at the warmth provided by the Emberbound Shaman's protective spells. The snow has a peculiar consistency, thick and dense, pulling at soldiers’ legs as they trudge forward.

Suddenly, the group encounters an ambush set by the Wind God’s lesser minions, spectral *White Walkers* whose icy forms blend seamlessly into the snowy landscape. With silent coordination, they launch an assault, materializing from snowbanks and ghostly mist, wielding weapons crafted from pure frost. Each strike from the White Walkers chills the bones, making the soldiers' armor brittle and more susceptible to further attacks.

Players are introduced to new combat mechanics here, requiring them to constantly shift positions to avoid the deadly reach of the White Walkers’ frost-imbued weapons. Some Knights use shields enchanted with heat runes, allowing them to deflect the attacks, while others wield torches, whose light disrupts the spectral beings. A few Emberbound Shamans and Necromancers band together, casting combined fire spells to create short bursts of warmth, repelling the spectral attackers for brief, crucial moments. 

The highlands themselves become a unique challenge, as shifting snow and sudden frost storms create an unpredictable battleground, demanding heightened vigilance and quick reflexes. Players gain a buff called *Iceborne Resistance* after surviving the ambush, temporarily granting increased stamina recovery and resistance to frost-based damage as they press onward.

**2. Frozenwall Citadel: The Guardian Stronghold**

With the White Walkers defeated and the highlands behind them, the army reaches the Frozenwall Citadel, an immense fortification looming on the horizon, shrouded in mist and frost. The citadel’s walls are fortified with ancient magic, etched with symbols that hum with otherworldly energy. This structure serves as the outermost line of defense for Nakazamian Castle, and breaching it is essential for the army’s advance.

The gates of the citadel are guarded by *Frostbound Guardians*, towering constructs crafted from enchanted ice and metal. Each Guardian is a formidable opponent, wielding colossal axes and hammers capable of shattering even the most resilient armor with a single strike. Their movements are slow, but each step resonates with power, causing the frozen ground to tremble. The Guardians radiate a frost aura that chills nearby soldiers to the bone, requiring players to keep their distance or risk immobilization.

Players face a new challenge in overcoming these behemoths. Working in coordinated teams, some draw the Guardians’ attention, allowing others to attack from behind, targeting weak points in their icy armor. Emberbound Shamans amplify their fire spells, focusing on melting the joints of the Frostbound Guardians, while Necromancers use draining spells to sap the Guardians' enchanted energy. Each defeat yields *Icebound Shards*, which can later be used to create unique items imbued with frost-resistant properties.

Once the Frostbound Guardians are defeated, the troops breach the main gate, entering the frigid interior of the citadel. Here, winding corridors and high archways amplify the chill, and the walls seem alive with faint echoes of past battles. Scouts push ahead, ensuring the path is clear, while the main force consolidates their position within the citadel, preparing for the final phase of the journey to Nakazamian Castle.

**3. Crossing the Frostbridge: A Test of Endurance**

Exiting the Frozenwall Citadel, the army encounters the Frostbridge—a treacherous, ice-laden bridge suspended high above a chasm that stretches down into shadowy depths. The bridge is enveloped in a dense mist, obscuring its end, and its surface is slick with frost. The sheer altitude makes even the most resilient warriors cautious, as strong winds buffet the bridge, howling like voices warning them to turn back.

The Frostbridge presents both a physical and mental trial. Here, players must navigate with extreme care, avoiding sections weakened by frost erosion. At certain intervals, powerful gusts generated by enchanted runes embedded along the bridge activate, threatening to knock soldiers off balance and into the abyss below. As players progress, they gain the ability *Steadfast March*, which boosts stability and allows for quicker recovery from the bridge’s destabilizing gusts.

Halfway across, the army is confronted by aerial minions of the Wind God known as *Gale Wraiths*. These spectral entities dive from above, moving with lightning speed, their shrill cries adding to the chaos of the crossing. They aim to disrupt the army’s formation, swooping down to disorient and strike soldiers with icy talons. Knights raise shields in unison, forming a protective barrier, while Pindars unleash long-range spells, targeting the Wraiths before they can descend. The Gale Wraiths possess a unique ability to dissipate into mist and reform elsewhere, making them particularly difficult to defeat.

Through coordinated teamwork and resilient spirit, the army finally reaches the other side of the bridge, though the ordeal leaves soldiers visibly drained and wary. Players emerge from the Frostbridge battle with a deepened sense of resolve, their eyes set firmly on the castle's looming gates.

**Closing of Sub-Chapter 2**

Sub-Chapter 2 concludes with the army rallying at the foot of Nakazamian Castle. The Frozenwall Citadel lies behind them, conquered, but the true test still looms ahead. As they stand before the castle’s towering, frost-covered gates, the air thick with an almost palpable malice, the players and NPCs alike brace themselves for what awaits within. With weapons drawn and hearts pounding, the siege of Nakazamian Castle is about to begin in earnest, as the army prepares to enter the heart of Thundralis’s domain in Sub-Chapter 3.
