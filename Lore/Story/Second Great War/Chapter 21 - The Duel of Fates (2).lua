			Chapter 21: Preparations for War

The **Ancient City of Sankis** buzzed with activity as both factions readied themselves for the impending conflict. The air was thick with purpose, each warrior and craftsman aware that the choices made in the coming days could alter the course of history. Under the watchful eyes of their leaders, the Knights and Pindars mobilized for war, each choosing its own territory to march into battle.

#### Knights’ Preparations in Lagooma Jungle

The Knights, driven by their desire for glory and the determination to reclaim their land, set their sights on the **Lagooma Jungle**. This dense, sprawling wilderness was both a blessing and a challenge—a place teeming with resources, yet fraught with peril. 

King Aric, alongside his trusted generals, gathered the Knights in the grand hall of Sankis to discuss their strategies. He emphasized the importance of unity, reminding them that their strength lay not just in individual skill, but in their ability to work as one. 

**“We will establish a stronghold deep within the jungle,”** Aric declared, his voice resonating with authority. **“The thick canopy will serve as our shield, while we lay traps to ensnare any enemy forces that dare to intrude.”**

The Knights set to work, crafting weapons and armor imbued with protective spells and enhancements. Blacksmiths hammered out gleaming swords and shields, while enchanters wove their magic into the fabric of the soldiers’ garments. Scouts ventured into the jungle, mapping out paths and identifying potential threats.

In preparation for the harsh conditions of the jungle, they stocked up on supplies—dried rations, medicinal herbs, and water purification tablets. The Knights also trained extensively, honing their skills in guerrilla tactics and ambush strategies, essential for navigating the treacherous terrain of Lagooma.

#### Pindars’ Preparations in the Frozen Territory

Meanwhile, the Pindars, led by Kellan and Thalion, chose to march into the **Frozen Territory**, an expanse of ice and snow that had long been the domain of the gods. They understood that this land would test their resolve, but they were determined to harness its bitter strength.

In the heart of their camp, Thalion convened a meeting to outline their strategy. **“The Frozen Territory will be our battleground,”** he proclaimed. **“We shall use the landscape to our advantage, leveraging the harsh weather to confuse and disorient our enemies.”**

Kellan, eager to assert his influence, suggested fortifying their position with hidden encampments and snow camouflaged gear. He advocated for the creation of ice barriers and traps designed to slow down any enemy advancement. 

**“We can utilize the terrain to set ambushes,”** Kellan urged. **“The blizzards will hide our movements, allowing us to strike swiftly and retreat into the shadows.”**

As their plans unfolded, the Pindars gathered supplies—warm furs, food rations that would withstand freezing temperatures, and specialized tools for navigating the icy landscape. They also engaged in rigorous training exercises, practicing their ability to fight in the snow and ice, preparing themselves for the grueling challenges that lay ahead.

#### The Road to War

As both factions fortified their territories, an unspoken rivalry simmered beneath the surface. Though they shared a common goal of defeating the gods, the differences in their strategies and approaches fueled a growing tension.

In the days leading up to their respective marches, scouts reported strange movements in both territories—shadows lurking at the edges of the jungle and eerie whispers carried by the icy winds. It was clear that the gods and their minions were aware of the impending conflict and would not allow the humans to proceed without resistance.

With the preparations nearly complete, both factions steeled themselves for the battles ahead. As they stood at the brink of war, each leader contemplated the weight of their choices, knowing that the outcomes would forever change their lands and their fates. The stage was set, and the flames of conflict were about to be ignited.
