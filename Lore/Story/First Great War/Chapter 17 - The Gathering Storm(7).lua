			Chapter 17: The Gathering Storm (Continued)

As the gods convened in their celestial domains, a ripple of concern spread through their ranks. Reports had reached them of human settlements in Normandy, near Nakazamian Castle. The realization that mortals had dared to encroach upon their sacred lands ignited a fury within them. They summoned their divine power, preparing to march against the human intruders.

**The Arrival of Noctis**

As the gods mobilized, a sudden dark presence filled the air. Noctis, the God of Night, emerged from the shadows, a cloak of darkness swirling around him. “You will not touch them,” he declared, his voice resonating like thunder. The gods turned their gaze toward him, their expressions a mixture of surprise and contempt.

“Noctis, this is not your battle!” boomed the Fire God, flames flickering in his eyes. 

“It is now,” Noctis replied, and with that, the clash began. The sky erupted in a cacophony of light and sound as Noctis fought against the gods, buying precious time for the humans to retreat. The air crackled with energy as divine forces collided, illuminating the darkened sky with flashes of brilliance. 

**The Human Retreat**

Back in the capital city, Kellan and his forces watched the distant battle unfold, their hearts heavy with the knowledge of their fragile situation. “We must sail back home,” Kellan urged, rallying his troops. “We can’t afford to lose any more men here. Our families depend on us!”

With a sense of urgency, the fleet set sail, the ships cutting through the waves, propelled by both fear and hope. As they reached the shores of the capital, the destruction was evident. Charred remains of buildings lay scattered, and the signs of conflict were everywhere. Clues hinted at Kellan's involvement—familiar weapons and tactics he had once employed.

**Scavenging for Resources**

Despite the devastation, Kellan led a group of soldiers to gather what they could salvage. They took food supplies, weapons, and any remaining resources, carefully loading their ships before moving on. “We need to find a safe place,” Kellan instructed. “Let’s head to that uncharted island. We can regroup there and plan our next move.”

As they arrived at the island, the soldiers set up a makeshift camp, establishing defenses and fortifying their position. They would wait here until their numbers swelled, readying themselves for the inevitable confrontation that loomed on the horizon.

**The Return to the Western Continent**

Upon returning to the western continent, a mixture of relief and dread washed over Kellan. The familiar landscapes were marred by the recent battles, yet his people remained resilient. They began distributing the resources they had gathered, preparing for the challenges ahead.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Noctis reappeared before Kellan, his presence a soothing balm in the turmoil. “You have much to learn,” Noctis said, his voice low and commanding. “The gods will not relent. You must prepare.”

“What can we do?” Kellan asked, desperation creeping into his tone.

Noctis extended his hand, and shadows coalesced into shimmering scrolls and tomes, ancient knowledge spilling forth. “These contain strategies and techniques for combating the gods. Use them wisely.” 

Kellan accepted the scrolls, understanding their significance. “Thank you, Noctis. We will honor your teachings.”

As Noctis faded into the night, Kellan felt a renewed sense of purpose. The battle was far from over, and he would do whatever it took to protect his people and reclaim their future.

### Chapter 18: The Darkening Sky

The preparations began in earnest. Kellan gathered the remaining council members, each one a key figure in the struggle against the divine. He knew that alliances would be essential. They would need to fortify their defenses, expand their army, and understand the gods’ weaknesses.

The night deepened, and Kellan stared at the stars, feeling the weight of destiny pressing upon him. The war had just begun, and the horizon was dark with promise and peril. The fate of humanity—and perhaps the world—rested in their hands.
