			Chapter 17: The Discovery of the Living Water

As the newly-formed headquarters of Aric’s coalition settled in the Aarong Forest, a sense of camaraderie grew among the soldiers. They fortified their position and shared stories of their victories, but a new expedition was on the horizon, one that would uncover secrets long buried beneath the earth.

**The Hidden Fountain**

During a routine patrol, a group of scouts stumbled upon a glimmering pool of water hidden among the dense foliage. Its surface shimmered like liquid crystal, captivating their attention. Word quickly spread, and Aric sent Berly, the king of dwarves, to investigate further.

As Berly approached the pool, he felt an ancient energy pulsating from it. “This is no ordinary water,” he murmured, kneeling by its edge. He scooped some into a flask and tasted it, feeling an immediate rush of vitality. “It’s… it’s healing! And rejuvenating!” 

Excitedly, Berly climbed the nearby mountain, driven by the need to uncover more about this miraculous source. There, he discovered an ancient temple adorned with strange symbols and inscriptions. As he traced the etchings with his fingers, the words began to unravel the temple’s secret:

*“This living water can expand the life of whoever drinks from it, three times in a row at dawn, but beware—your heart must be clean of impurities or…”*

Berly returned to the camp, his mind racing with possibilities. He gathered Aric, Thalion, and the others to share the discovery, emphasizing the importance of secrecy. They decided to fill elixirs with the water, vowing to keep the fountain hidden and protect its magic.

**A Treacherous Plan**

However, among the ranks was a general named Garron, Kellan’s right-hand man, who had always been envious of Kellan’s rise in status. Sensing an opportunity, he plotted to seize the water’s power for himself. In the dead of night, he gathered a small group of loyal followers and secretly filled additional elixirs with the precious liquid.

Garron’s plan was straightforward: consume the elixirs, gain the enhanced vitality, and then abandon Kellan and the army to forge his own destiny. He led his companions into the depths of the forest, away from the camp, to avoid detection.

After three days of hiding, waiting for the elixirs to take effect, Garron felt a surge of power coursing through him. The others shared in this newfound vigor, their strength and endurance heightened beyond their previous limits. It was time to return to the camp and gauge the situation.

**A Chance Encounter**

As Garron and his group navigated through the woods, they unexpectedly crossed paths with Kellan, who was surveying the area near the ships docked on the shore. Kellan, unaware of Garron’s treachery, felt an instinctive tension in the air.

“Garron! What are you doing out here?” Kellan called out, suspicion lacing his voice.

Garron, quick on his feet, played it cool. “I was scouting, my lord. Just wanted to see how things were going at the docks,” he replied, forcing a grin. “I didn’t expect to run into you here.”

Kellan narrowed his eyes, but a wave of unease washed over him. “We have much to discuss. There’s news from the army that you should be aware of.”

As Kellan and Garron engaged in conversation, Garron’s mind raced. He needed to be careful, as Kellan’s intuition was sharp. He couldn’t let on that he had plans to break away. 

After a brief exchange, Garron suggested a walk toward the camp to hear the latest developments. However, a flicker of doubt crossed Kellan's mind, a whisper of intuition telling him something was amiss.

**The Tension Builds**

As they made their way through the woods, Garron felt the thrill of deception fueling him. With each step, he mentally prepared himself for the moment he would betray Kellan, claiming the power of the elixirs for himself and his select group.

Meanwhile, Kellan’s suspicion only deepened. He had sensed that Garron had changed, his demeanor sharper, almost predatory. As they approached the camp, Kellan prepared to confront Garron, determined to uncover the truth behind his enigmatic behavior.

The chapter drew to a close, a precipice of conflict looming as loyalties began to fray and hidden agendas threatened to erupt into chaos. Kellan stood on the edge of discovery, unaware that betrayal lurked just behind him, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.
