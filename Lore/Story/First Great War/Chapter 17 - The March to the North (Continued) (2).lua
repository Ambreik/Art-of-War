			Chapter 17: The March to the North (Continued)

As the morning sun cast its rays over the Aarong Forest, Aric and his commanders finalized their plans for the impending battle. The air was tense with anticipation, and the soldiers prepared themselves, knowing that their fates were intertwined with the outcome of the confrontation ahead. Kellan, however, watched with a calculating gaze, his mind racing with ambitions of his own.

**The Confrontation with Thalion**

When the time came, Aric’s forces marched deep into the heart of the Aarong Forest. The lush greenery that surrounded them soon gave way to a clearing where King Thalion of the werewolves awaited, his presence commanding and fierce. The two leaders had agreed to unite their forces to face the imminent threat from the armies of the Wind God, who had long sought dominion over the Northern Continent.

As they approached, Kellan stepped forward, masking his internal conflict with a facade of camaraderie. "Together, we can defeat them. But we must strategize carefully," he urged, glancing at Thalion. The werewolf king, with his piercing eyes and noble demeanor, nodded in agreement, sensing Kellan’s hidden motives but choosing to trust him—for now.

The forces of the Wind God were known for their speed and ferocity, their warriors wielding the elemental power of storms. They had descended upon the forest like a tempest, eager to claim the Northern lands. As the battle commenced, Kellan fought alongside Thalion, using his skills to rally the troops against the swirling winds and relentless assaults.

**The Final Battle**

The clash of steel echoed through the forest as the two armies collided. Kellan proved to be a master tactician, orchestrating ambushes and leveraging the terrain to their advantage. Thalion fought with the ferocity of a wolf, his instincts guiding him as he tore through the enemy lines. 

Yet, Kellan’s mind was not solely focused on the battle at hand; it was a chess game for him. Each movement was calculated not just for victory, but for power. As the tide of battle swayed, he saw an opening—a chance to prove himself to Thalion and Aric.

“Now! Flank them from the right!” Kellan shouted, leading a small contingent of warriors into a surprise attack that caught the Wind God’s forces off guard. The strategy worked, turning the tide in their favor. With the momentum shifting, Thalion rallied his werewolves, and together they pushed forward, driving back the enemy until victory was within their grasp.

When the dust settled, the army of the Wind God lay defeated, their once-mighty forces scattered in disarray. Cheers erupted from the ranks of Aric’s army, a mixture of human and werewolf warriors celebrating their hard-fought triumph.

**A Deceptive Request**

In the aftermath of the battle, Kellan approached Thalion and Aric, feigning gratitude. “We have done the impossible today, but we cannot rest on our laurels. We need reinforcements to secure our victory and protect our newfound territory,” he said, his voice smooth and persuasive.

“I request your permission to return to the Middlean Islands,” Kellan proposed, keeping his tone sincere. “I will gather our allies and bring back much-needed supplies and troops.”

Aric, buoyed by their victory, nodded. “Very well, Kellan. We will need your cunning in the days to come. But return swiftly; we cannot afford to lose momentum.”

With a false sense of loyalty, Kellan accepted the terms and set off on his journey, the wheels of his treachery already turning in his mind.

**The Great Sea Crossing**

Once he reached the Middlean Islands, Kellan wasted no time. Under the cover of night, he orchestrated a brutal coup against the inhabitants of the capital city. His spies had already mapped out the layout of the island, and he took two massive warships, loading them with goods, supplies, and any wealth he could find.

“Leave no witnesses,” he ordered coldly as his men followed his lead, ruthlessly slaying anyone who opposed them. The carnage was swift, and with the ships stocked, Kellan set sail across the Great Sea.

As the waves crashed against the hull, Kellan’s thoughts turned to what lay ahead. He had heard whispers of powerful relics and resources uncovered in the Northern Continent, remnants of the gods’ former might. If he could seize these treasures, he could finally establish himself as a force to be reckoned with, not just a pawn in Aric’s game.

**The Journey North**

With the horizon stretching before him, Kellan navigated his ships northward, his heart racing with the thrill of the impending betrayal. The time for loyalty was over; he would carve his path through treachery and cunning.

“Soon, I will have the power to reshape this world,” he muttered to himself as the wind whipped through his hair. The Northern Continent awaited, and with it, the chance to claim dominion over all.

The chapter concluded with Kellan’s warships sailing into the unknown, a figure of ambition cloaked in shadows, leaving behind a fragile alliance destined to be tested by betrayal and the weight of his unyielding thirst for power.
