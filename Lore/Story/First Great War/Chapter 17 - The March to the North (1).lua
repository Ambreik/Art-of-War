			Chapter 17: The March to the North

As the sun rose over the Western Continent, its golden rays illuminated the banners of the Bolemir family that fluttered proudly in the breeze. King Aric stood at the forefront of his assembled army, resolute and determined. He had called upon every ally and soldier at his disposal, rallying them for the decisive campaign against the gods and their relentless armies in the Northern Continent.

Yet, amidst the unity of purpose, an unseen shadow loomed. Kellan, the brother-in-law of King Aric, had taken to the shadows, his motives veiled in secrecy. Though he had been present during the preparations, Aric remained blissfully unaware of Kellan’s cunning. The brother-in-law had infiltrated his ranks, planting spies within the army to monitor Aric’s movements and intentions, all while biding his time for the perfect moment to strike.

**The Call to Arms**

“Today, we march to reclaim our land!” Aric shouted, his voice echoing through the ranks. “Together, we will face the gods and their monstrous armies. This is our chance to prove our strength!”

The soldiers cheered, their spirits lifted by their king’s fervor. But Kellan felt the weight of betrayal in his heart. He had worked tirelessly to earn respect and loyalty among the werewolves, especially from King Thalion. While Aric’s army prepared for glory, Kellan plotted his own course, seeking to build alliances in the shadows for his future ambitions.

**Aarong Forest**

As the days passed, the army of humanity advanced northward, traversing the rugged terrain and dense foliage of the Northern Continent. They crossed rivers and climbed mountains, eventually arriving at a vast expanse of trees that Aric named the "Aarong Forest," a fitting tribute to the ancient spirits said to dwell within its depths.

Upon reaching the forest's edge, they established a headquarters along the shore of a serene lake that sparkled under the sun. Here, the whispers of the wind carried tales of the past, and the shadows of the trees seemed to hold secrets untold.

“This will be our stronghold,” Aric declared, surveying the tranquil yet foreboding surroundings. “From here, we will launch our assaults against the gods’ forces.”

**The Tensions Unfold**

While Aric focused on the campaign ahead, Kellan remained in the shadows, nurturing his resentment. He had seen the potential for power in the werewolves, especially with Thalion's growing influence. Kellan needed to play his cards carefully, aligning himself with the right allies while plotting his ultimate betrayal.

“Trust must be earned,” he would remind himself, echoing Tarek’s words from the Middlean Islands. His loyalty to Aric had always been shallow, but his desire for power had grown exponentially. Kellan envisioned a time when he would stand at the forefront, not as Aric's subordinate but as a ruler in his own right.

**The Night Before Battle**

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting an orange glow over the Aarong Forest, the tension in the camp was palpable. Soldiers gathered around campfires, sharing stories and preparing for the battle that awaited them. The sound of laughter mixed with the crackling of flames, a momentary reprieve from the reality that loomed ahead.

But Kellan stood apart, his thoughts consumed by ambition. He lingered in the shadows, watching Aric as he strategized with his commanders. Kellan knew the time would come to act, and when it did, he would ensure that Thalion and the werewolves were on his side.

“Patience,” he whispered to himself, “patience will lead to victory.”

**A New Dawn**

As dawn broke, the soldiers of the Bolemir family prepared for their first confrontation in Aarong Forest. The air was thick with anticipation, and the forest, though beautiful, felt alive with danger. Aric’s army was ready to face whatever challenges awaited them, unaware that betrayal was lurking among their ranks.

The chapter closed with the camp buzzing with energy and hope, but beneath the surface, the currents of ambition and treachery stirred, setting the stage for the conflicts to come. As the sun rose higher, illuminating the path ahead, the fate of the Northern Continent hung precariously in the balance, with Kellan waiting for the right moment to strike.
