			Chapter 17: Shadows of Betrayal (Continued)

As the weary travelers made their way through the vast expanse of the Frozen Territory, they stumbled upon a place whispered about in hushed tones: Normandy. The air grew colder, and an ominous chill settled in as they approached a formidable sight—an immense wall of icy stones surrounding a colossal structure looming in the distance.

**The Icy Fortress of Nakazamian Castle**

The towering ice walls of Nakazamian Castle rose like jagged teeth against the bleak sky, a fortress that seemed to embody the very essence of evil. Kellan and his companions stood in awe, both fearful and curious about what lay beyond the imposing gates. “This place feels… wrong,” Liora said, her voice barely a whisper. The castle had an aura of foreboding, as if it held secrets too dark to be revealed.

As they approached the castle, they were met with an unexpected sight. Emerging from the shadows of the fortress was the Water God, a being of shimmering blues and greens, seemingly weakened and disoriented. “I’ve been driven from my domain,” he murmured, his voice laced with despair. “The weapons forged by Berly have turned the tide against me.”

Kellan, recognizing the opportunity, saw a chance to exploit the god’s vulnerability. “We could use your power,” he said, though beneath his calm facade, his mind raced with thoughts of betrayal. 

**Alucard’s Quest**

Meanwhile, Alucard had embarked on a separate mission with three of his strongest vampire allies. They sought the Wind God, armed with knowledge of how to defeat him, yet their efforts were in vain. After three grueling days of searching, they returned, defeated but alive. “We cannot confront him yet,” Alucard declared, his dark eyes glinting with determination. “Our time will come, but for now, we must regroup and assess King Aric’s actions.”

**The Balcony Confrontation**

Back in Nakazamian Castle, tensions were high. King Aric stood on a balcony overlooking the icy landscape, his expression grave. Kellan joined him, his heart racing with anger and resentment. “You’ve been keeping secrets,” Kellan accused, his voice low but laced with fury. “This elixir you speak of—it’s not just for the benefit of your reign. You want to maintain your immortality while the rest of us are left to fight your battles!”

Aric looked taken aback but quickly regained his composure. “Kellan, this elixir is a safeguard against the sentinels of ice that surround us. It can grant you a chance at survival, but you must understand—”

“I know all about the elixir!” Kellan interrupted, his voice rising. “I had spies in your army. I know what you’ve been doing, and it’s clear to me that you don’t deserve to wear the crown.”

The argument escalated, each word sharp as ice, until Kellan, fueled by his mounting rage, lunged at Aric. In a furious clash, he pushed the king back, nearly knocking him off the balcony.

**The Arrival of Alucard**

Just as the final blow was about to strike, Alucard materialized beside them, his presence both a shock and a surprise. “Enough!” he shouted, and with a swift movement, he pushed Kellan off the balcony, sending him tumbling down.

Kellan’s world spun as he fell, but Alucard wasn’t done yet. In a desperate attempt to save Aric, he leaned in, biting the king’s neck to share his own vampiric healing powers. “You must trust me, King Aric,” he urged. “You need this to survive.”

However, Aric fought against him, pushing Alucard away. “No! I refuse to become like you!” With a powerful flap of his wings, Alucard lifted Aric into the air, soaring away from the castle just as Kellan scrambled to his feet below, heart racing.

**Kellan’s Flight**

Kellan hit the ground hard but managed to regain his footing. The betrayal burned in his chest as he watched Alucard carry Aric away. Furious, he gathered some of his soldiers and made a hasty retreat toward the shore, where their boats waited.

Upon reaching the shore, Kellan gasped for breath, his mind racing. Just as he reached the vessels, he saw the king of werewolves approaching, a fierce expression on his face. “Kellan!” Thalion shouted, noticing the state he was in. “What happened?”

Kellan recounted the events, the betrayal, and his near confrontation with Aric. “We need to prepare for a campaign to conquer the western continent,” Kellan declared, a dark resolve forming within him. “We cannot allow them to regroup and strengthen their position.”

With a nod of understanding, Thalion rallied his own forces, preparing to set sail for the eastern continent, where they would strategize their next move. The cold winds howled around them, mirroring the brewing storm of conflict that lay ahead, as Kellan plotted his path to revenge, a deep-seated desire for power driving him forward into the unknown.
