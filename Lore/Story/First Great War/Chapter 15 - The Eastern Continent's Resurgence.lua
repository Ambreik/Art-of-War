			Chapter 15: The Eastern Continent's Resurgence

The battle on the Ashen Plains raged into the night, the air thick with smoke and the acrid scent of burning flesh. As the moon rose high, its silver light illuminated the carnage below, but it also revealed a glimmer of hope among the allied forces. 

#### Rallying the Forces

In the aftermath of the skirmish, Rorik gathered the leaders of the newly formed coalition at a makeshift command tent, its tattered fabric barely shielding them from the night’s chill. Around a large map of the eastern continent, they discussed their next steps.

“We’ve made progress, but we cannot grow complacent,” Rorik urged, his brow furrowed in concentration. “The gnolls will regroup and strike again. We need a plan that will allow us to push them back decisively.”

King Aric, still recovering from the chaos of battle, nodded in agreement. “I propose we use the Middlean Islands as a base for our next offensive. With control over those islands, we can cut off the gnolls’ supply lines and prevent them from launching further attacks.”

Liora, her eyes glimmering with determination, added, “We should leverage our newfound allies. The sea serpents know these waters well; they can help us navigate and strike where the gnolls least expect it.”

#### A Plan Takes Shape

The leaders devised a multi-pronged strategy. Half of their forces would remain on the eastern continent to defend against further gnoll incursions, while the other half, led by King Aric, would embark for the Middlean Islands. The council agreed to send Nimba, the Conqueror, to command the fleet, her fierce presence promising a show of strength on the open sea.

As dawn broke, the allied forces prepared for their dual missions. Dwarves worked tirelessly to forge new weapons and armor, while elves crafted intricate traps designed to ensnare the gnolls. The atmosphere crackled with determination, each warrior ready to fight for their home.

#### The Assault on the Middlean Islands

With the sun rising, the ships set sail, their sails billowing in the fresh morning breeze. Nimba stood at the bow of her vessel, the Windrider, her keen eyes scanning the horizon. “We will make landfall before noon,” she declared, her voice strong and confident. “Prepare yourselves for battle!”

As they approached the islands, the sight of their lush greenery contrasted sharply with the desolation left by the gnolls. Nimba signaled for the fleet to anchor just offshore. They disembarked quickly, forming a defensive perimeter as they surveyed their new territory.

Upon landing, the allied forces discovered that the islands had not been entirely abandoned. The remnants of a once-thriving civilization had left behind scattered ruins, and among them, a few desperate islanders remained. These locals, initially fearful of the newcomers, soon recognized the strength of the united forces and offered their allegiance.

#### Allies in Unexpected Places

The islanders shared vital intelligence about the gnoll movements and their supply routes. With their help, the allied forces devised a plan to ambush a gnoll supply convoy that was due to pass through the central channel of the islands.

As the sun dipped low in the sky, casting long shadows across the land, the allied forces set their trap. They hid among the dense underbrush, their breaths held in anticipation. The gnolls, unaware of the impending danger, marched confidently toward the ambush.

With a loud roar, the allied forces sprang into action. Arrows rained down from the trees, cutting through gnoll ranks, while warriors charged from the underbrush, swords drawn and battle cries echoing through the air. The element of surprise was theirs, and they fought with ferocity.

#### The Battle for the Islands

Nimba fought at the forefront, her blade dancing in the fading light as she cut down gnolls left and right. She moved with grace, her instincts honed by countless battles. The gnolls, caught off guard, struggled to respond to the overwhelming assault. 

Meanwhile, King Aric commanded his troops with the precision of a seasoned leader. “Push forward! Do not relent!” he shouted, rallying his warriors as they clashed against the gnolls’ defenses. The gnoll leaders, realizing their peril, began to organize a counterattack.

But the tide had turned. With the islanders providing crucial support and the allied forces working in unison, the gnolls found themselves overwhelmed. One by one, their ranks began to break, and soon, the cries of retreat filled the air.

#### The Aftermath

As the battle waned and the sun set, the allied forces stood victorious on the Middlean Islands. Exhausted but elated, they regrouped to assess the situation. The gnoll supply convoy had been decimated, and their morale shattered. 

Rorik’s voice rang out as he stepped forward, “Today, we have shown that we can stand against the gnolls! This victory is but the first step. We must continue to push them back and reclaim our lands!”

With the islands secured, the allies began fortifying their position. They constructed barricades and established watchtowers, preparing for the inevitable gnoll retaliation. Nimba took charge of the naval operations, coordinating the ships to ensure they had a swift response force ready for any attacks.

#### The Eastern Continent's Future

Meanwhile, on the eastern mainland, the other council members continued to defend against gnoll incursions. They fortified their positions, ensuring that their territories remained safe while King Aric and Nimba spearheaded the push from the islands.

As the days turned into weeks, hope flickered in the hearts of the allied forces. The tide of war had begun to shift, but they knew they must remain vigilant. The gnolls would not concede easily, and the true battle for the eastern continent was far from over.

The united forces prepared for the next phase of their campaign, ready to reclaim what had been lost and establish a future free from the shadows of tyranny. The Eastern Continent, once on the brink of despair, now stood resilient—a testament to the strength of unity in the face of overwhelming odds.
