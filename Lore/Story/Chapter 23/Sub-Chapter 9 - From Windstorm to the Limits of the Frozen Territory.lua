			Sub-Chapter 9: From Windstorm to the Limits of the Frozen Territory

The journey from Windstorm to Nakazamian Castle was fraught with challenges as the allied forces traversed treacherous landscapes and encountered waves of enemies. The presence of the Cyclone Titan, now allied with Pindar’s forces, proved invaluable as it shielded the soldiers from the relentless winds and provided an immense, towering threat that discouraged the God of Wind’s minions from direct confrontation.

The expedition soon approached **Frostwail Gorge**, a narrow, ice-lined passage known for its deadly reputation. According to the Titan, this gorge was lined with enchantments that only those loyal to the Wind God could safely pass. Scouting parties reported that the path ahead was littered with dangerous traps: columns of ice that could collapse without warning, invisible sigils triggering frost explosions, and jagged cliffs that crumbled upon contact. Commanders from both factions collaborated to identify safe routes and devised countermeasures for the deadly enchantments.

Pindar and Aric instructed their soldiers to alternate in small squads, setting up temporary camps and waypoints within the gorge. Scouts used specialized **Veilstones**—enchanted crystals—to detect hidden sigils and traps. A skirmish soon erupted when a battalion of White Walkers, alerted by the soldiers’ progress, ambushed them from hidden crevices in the icy walls. **Thalia the Shadowblade**, an agile warrior skilled in stealth and close-quarters combat, led a flanking counterattack, using the narrow paths of the gorge to trap and eliminate the attackers.

At the gorge’s exit, the allied forces encountered **Stormbound Sentinel**, a colossal, rune-etched statue that served as a final gatekeeper. Reactivated by their presence, the statue unleashed a relentless barrage of icy winds, forcing Pindar’s forces to retreat and rethink their approach. Pindar ordered his mages to analyze the statue's runes and identified a weak point—an exposed core within the statue’s chest.

The knights formed a diversionary team to draw the statue’s attention while Thalia and a specialized strike force climbed the surrounding cliffs to access its vulnerable core. Using grappling hooks and expert mountaineering skills, the team scaled the cliffside under intense conditions. Once in position, they launched a coordinated attack on the core, cracking it open and causing the Sentinel to collapse. The statue crumbled, marking a hard-won victory and clearing the path to the limits of Nakazamian Castle’s influence.

At the border of Nakazamian’s mystical territory, Pindar, Aric, and their strategists took stock of their forces. Having lost several troops to ambushes and traps, they knew that confronting the Wind God would require their combined strength, focus, and more precise tactics. Scouts brought back vital intelligence, noting the presence of **Stormshrike Riders**—elite aerial forces loyal to the Wind God who patrolled the skies, ready to rain down elemental attacks upon any intruders. The allied forces prepared to engage these foes and dismantle the final lines of defense as they drew closer to Nakazamian Castle’s outer gates.
