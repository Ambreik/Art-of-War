			Sub-Chapter 10: The Approach to Nakazamian Castle

As the allied forces advanced beyond Frostwail Gorge and regrouped, a sense of both awe and trepidation filled the ranks. In the distance, the towering silhouette of **Nakazamian Castle** rose from the frozen horizon, surrounded by massive, spiraling storm clouds that crackled with violent bursts of thunder. These clouds weren’t natural—they were a manifestation of the Wind God’s power, a final barrier that warned of the looming battle. The sight was as mesmerizing as it was menacing; each bolt of lightning illuminated the imposing architecture of the fortress, casting long shadows that seemed to move with a will of their own.

**Pindar and Aric** gathered their commanders for a final war council, analyzing the layout of the castle grounds and devising a strategy for what would be a layered assault. Their scouts had mapped the outer defenses and revealed the main obstacles: enchanted walls, elemental constructs patrolling the perimeter, and the **Stormshrike Riders**—elite warriors mounted on spectral eagles that could command the winds to unleash gusts powerful enough to knock soldiers off their feet. It was clear that both ground and aerial forces would be essential to breaking through the outer defenses.

To adapt, Pindar’s knights divided into three units, each assigned specific roles. **Unit 1**, led by **General Aldric**, a disciplined tactician known for his defensive strategies, would hold the frontline, using heavy shields and magical barriers to withstand attacks from above and protect the advancing ranks. **Unit 2**, under **Captain Helia’s** command, would be the primary assault force, tasked with targeting the castle gates. Helia’s precision archers had been equipped with storm-piercing arrows—rare weapons infused with Veilstones—to counter the Stormshrike Riders.

The third group, **Unit 3**, consisted of Aric’s skilled rogues and mages, led by **Thalia the Shadowblade**. Their mission was to infiltrate Nakazamian’s side defenses, using the cover of the storms and shadows to disable arcane traps and weaken the castle's magical fortifications. With the Cyclone Titan positioned at the center, Pindar hoped to use its strength to block incoming elemental strikes and break through any unexpected defenses.

As they advanced, the first encounter came with the **Stormshrike Riders**. These spectral warriors, mounted on massive eagles formed from concentrated wind and ice, dived down with devastating accuracy. The force of their wind magic swept through the ranks, and many soldiers had to brace themselves against the onslaught. General Aldric, true to his reputation, commanded his unit to raise their shields and form a **Defensive Phalanx**. This formation created a protective wall, deflecting the worst of the attacks and allowing the knights to advance inch by inch.

Meanwhile, Captain Helia’s archers took advantage of the brief pauses between dives to unleash volleys of storm-piercing arrows. These arrows soared with uncanny accuracy, piercing through the enchanted armor of the riders and dissipating the spectral eagles into whirling gusts of wind. Slowly, the allied forces gained ground.

As the phalanx reached the castle gates, they encountered the **Tempest Behemoths**, massive creatures of wind and stone tasked with guarding the entrance. Each step these behemoths took caused the ground to tremble, and their fists could generate shockwaves powerful enough to send even the most fortified soldiers flying. The Cyclone Titan, sensing the challenge, stepped forward and engaged the behemoths head-on.

While the Titan held the behemoths at bay, Thalia and Unit 3 slipped through the castle’s side defenses. Navigating through enchanted barriers and magical traps, they moved with a stealth born of experience and necessity. Thalia’s team encountered **Abyssal Sentries**—statue-like guardians that could sense even the slightest movement. With practiced silence, the rogues disabled these sentries, allowing the mages to focus on dispelling the fortress's layered enchantments.

Once inside the first level of the castle, Thalia’s group faced the **Hurricane Wardens**—elemental beings crafted from pure wind and lightning. Unlike the Tempest Behemoths outside, these beings could phase through walls, attacking from unexpected angles and shifting to avoid physical attacks. Recognizing the need for strategy over brute force, Thalia directed her mages to cast binding spells, which anchored the wardens to the floor, allowing her rogues to dispatch them.

Back at the main gates, the combined force of Pindar’s and Aric’s units managed to push past the Tempest Behemoths, finally breaching the entrance of Nakazamian Castle. They entered the main courtyard, where the storm above intensified, swirling with a chaotic energy that mirrored the fury of the Wind God himself. Here, they encountered **Stormshroud**, a warlock of immense power and the Wind God’s right hand. Stormshroud wielded a staff that channeled the winds, creating whirlwinds that tore through the knights’ formations and isolated soldiers from their comrades.

Pindar himself stepped forward to confront Stormshroud, who hurled blasts of wind and lightning that carved through stone and steel. The courtyard became a battlefield of elemental fury, as Stormshroud summoned **Lightning Specters**—phantom warriors composed of storm energy that struck like lightning. However, Pindar’s shield, imbued with Veilstone, deflected much of the assault. With each clash, Stormshroud seemed to grow weaker, as if his power was being drained by the storm raging above.

At last, Pindar, with a decisive strike, shattered Stormshroud’s staff, causing a backlash of energy that dissipated the specters and weakened the storms overhead. The warlock fell, his defeat a clear signal that the outer defenses of Nakazamian Castle had been breached. But as the storm above began to dissipate slightly, the soldiers glimpsed the true extent of the castle's power and the final challenge awaiting them within its walls.

With the outer defenses subdued, the allied forces prepared to venture deeper into Nakazamian Castle, knowing that the Wind God himself awaited within, ready to defend his dominion against the intruders.
