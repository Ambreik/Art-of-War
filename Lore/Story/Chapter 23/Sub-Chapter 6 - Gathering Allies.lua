			Sub-Chapter 6: Gathering Allies

After the fall of Windstorm and a retreat to Aarong Forest, Pindar’s army was in dire need of reinforcement. The morale was low, resources were scarce, and the tales of the White Walkers’ strength had only grown with each retreat. Back at the Aarong Forest base, Pindar met with **Aric** and his troops to recount the harsh conditions and losses faced in the Frozen Territory, emphasizing the need for reinforcements and supplies.

Among Aric’s ranks was **Commander Sylas**, a seasoned strategist known for his innovative warfare tactics. Sylas, upon hearing of the formidable elemental defenses and the overwhelming number of White Walkers, proposed a counter-strategy that would blend direct assault with guerrilla tactics, focusing on small, calculated strikes on key targets to weaken the enemy’s core. Sylas also suggested sending out scouts to learn more about the wind elemental forces, ensuring that their next offensive would be meticulously planned and better informed.

The time spent regrouping and training was invaluable. Pindar’s army gained skilled warriors, and Sylas’s leadership attracted volunteers from various nearby settlements eager to join the cause. They fortified their armor, restocked on supplies, and trained day and night, preparing to execute Sylas’s strategy of divided, precise strikes, aimed at destabilizing the White Walkers and their elemental guardians.

To inspire unity and motivation, Aric shared the legend of **Frostbane**, an ancient weapon rumored to be capable of harnessing ice’s fury and wielding it against creatures of frost and wind. Though many dismissed it as mere folklore, the idea of Frostbane emboldened the troops, fueling rumors that perhaps, within the peaks of Highland, they might discover a weapon or force powerful enough to turn the tide.

When the final day of preparations arrived, the combined armies of Pindar and Aric moved out, with Sylas and Arcus leading specialized teams on covert missions to weaken enemy forces from the inside. With both the strategy and the resolve firmly in place, they embarked on their path back to Highland, fully committed to reclaiming Windstorm and pressing onward against the God of Wind.
