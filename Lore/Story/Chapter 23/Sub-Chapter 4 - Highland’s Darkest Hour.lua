			Sub-Chapter 4: Highland’s Darkest Hour

Leaving the frost-ridden grounds of Northshire Fryy, Pindar’s forces made their way to **Highland**, a rugged and mountainous terrain where the wind howled with an unnatural force. Here, the presence of the God of Wind felt stronger than ever, and his influence seemed to warp even the landscape, with jagged cliffs and treacherous ravines cloaked in perpetual snowstorms. As the knights climbed higher into Highland’s reaches, they were met with merciless resistance.

Their advance was quickly hindered by an unexpected ambush from a legion of White Walkers and other corrupted beasts. Highland’s creatures were vicious, mutated by the God of Wind’s dark power, and seemed almost immune to the cold. The **Frost Wraith**, an imposing figure with ethereal white armor and a shadowy visage, led the charge against the knights. Known for his ability to drain the life force of any who dared approach, the Frost Wraith instilled fear among Pindar’s troops, causing some to waver in their resolve.

The knights managed to form a defensive perimeter, but the relentless blizzards hindered their movements and rendered visibility nearly zero. **Commander Roderic**, one of Pindar’s most trusted tacticians, took command of the left flank and issued a strategic fallback to lure the Frost Wraith’s forces into an ambush. Roderic, a seasoned veteran of many battles, recognized that a head-on clash would only lead to further losses in these harsh conditions.

Using their surroundings to their advantage, the knights devised traps and set fires to illuminate the battlefield. They lured the White Walkers and their beastly allies into narrow passes, where archers rained down arrows and mages unleashed torrents of flame. Despite their best efforts, the battle proved grueling, with casualties mounting under the Wraith’s relentless assault. Several smaller outposts were erected as temporary sanctuaries, but it became clear that the toll of the highlands was steep.

Finally, with a desperate rally led by Pindar himself, the knights struck the Frost Wraith down. Yet the victory came at a heavy cost, and Pindar’s forces were left severely depleted. Recognizing their limitations, Pindar ordered a retreat from Highland and a regrouping at **Aarong Forest** to reinforce their numbers and refine their strategies. Worn and weary, they left Highland with a newfound respect for the challenges ahead.
