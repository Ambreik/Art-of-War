			The Primordial Lore of Yonia: Chapter Four – Shadows of Conflict

The air crackled with tension as Flammar, the God of Fire, summoned his fellow deities to a grand meeting atop the highest peak of the Great Mountain, a natural barrier separating the four regions of Yonia. This location was chosen for its neutrality, a point where the realms converged. Flammar sought answers about the enigmatic figure of **Noctis**, the newly created god of shadows, whose presence had cast a long shadow over the ambitions of the elemental deities.

As the gods gathered, Flammar’s fiery spirit burned with determination. "We must understand what Noctis truly is," he declared. "He possesses powers that challenge our very dominion over this realm, and I will not allow him to disrupt our plans."

The other gods nodded in agreement, albeit with varying degrees of concern. They understood that Noctis could either be an ally or a formidable adversary. Just as the meeting commenced, a dark mist enveloped the summit. From the shadows, **Noctis** emerged, not as a single being but as multiple clones, each one a reflection of the thoughts hidden deep within the hearts of the gods.

"You speak of dominion," one Noctis clone echoed, its voice resonating through the air. "Each of you harbors ambitions, dreams of ruling over this realm, yet your fears bind you. Only Palloc remains true to the purpose of creation, while the rest conspire for power."

Flammar, furious at the revelation of their inner thoughts, felt his anger ignite. "You dare to confront us with our weaknesses?" he roared, his voice like the crackling of flames.

But Noctis merely smiled, shadows swirling around him, revealing his intent. "I am here to maintain the balance you have disrupted. Your ambition blinds you to the harmony that must exist among us."

In that moment, Flammar saw an opportunity to turn the tide. Fueled by his desire to eliminate the shadowy threat, he commanded his mighty dragons to attack Noctis, while simultaneously unleashing his **Fire Dragons** upon the other gods, hoping to incite chaos and weaken any alliances.

As the dragons took to the skies, the ground shook beneath the weight of their wings. The air filled with roars of fire and cries of battle, marking the dawn of the **First Great War**.

In the realms below, giants were summoned to fortify their territories. Palloc, steadfast in his purpose, rallied his **Golems** and **Giants** to create barriers and fortifications across the continent. They worked tirelessly, raising stone walls and creating shelters for the smaller creatures caught in the chaos. Despite Palloc’s efforts, the lands were soon engulfed in turmoil.

As the **Dragons** swept through the skies, entire regions trembled. The **Water Serpents** emerged from the oceans, joining their brethren in defense of the Naga Nation. In response, Horras unleashed his Kraken and Sea Orcs, creating a ferocious defense against the fiery onslaught. The water surged, crashing against the shores in a battle of elemental might.

Meanwhile, the **Rock Dragons** and **Wind Wyverns** rallied their forces, joining Flammar in the assault. They swept through the forests, forcing the **Gnolls** and **Giants** to defend their territory, leading to fierce skirmishes where loyalty and ambition clashed.

In the thick of battle, Noctis danced among the chaos, his shadows allowing him to evade the onslaught. He toyed with Flammar’s dragons, using their fury against them, until finally, he unleashed a surge of dark energy. One by one, the dragons fell, their spirits drawn into the Underworld Realm, their blood seeping into the ground and giving rise to new and fearsome creatures.

From this spilled essence emerged **Werewolves**, cursed beings that roamed the night, their howls echoing through the forests. With the strength of the dragons coursing through them, these new creatures became a force to be reckoned with, further complicating the already tumultuous battle.

As the war raged on, each region experienced the conflict in unique ways:

- **In the Flame Region**, fire and ash filled the air as the Fire Dragons clashed with the elemental spirits of water. The land erupted in flames, while the smoke darkened the skies, creating an atmosphere of despair among those who had once thrived under Flammar’s guidance.

- **In the Earth Region**, Palloc's giants worked furiously to defend against both Flammar’s and Horras’ forces. The ground shook as the giants erected massive fortifications, but as they fought against the tide of dragons, their strength was tested.

- **In the Sea Region**, the Naga Nation united with the Kraken and Sea Orcs, rising from the depths to combat the fiery onslaught. The waters roiled as battles erupted both above and below the surface, with the fate of their underwater realm hanging in the balance.

- **In the Sky**, Oxogol’s Lightning Beings darted through the clouds, unleashing bolts of electricity upon the dragons and the creatures of the earth. The storm roared in fury as the wyverns conducted reconnaissance, providing vital intelligence but also facing the wrath of Noctis.

The continent of Yonia became a battlefield, as alliances formed and fractured amidst the chaos of war. Noctis, with his mastery of shadows and emotions, danced through the conflict, seeking to maintain the delicate balance that had been so violently disrupted.

As the gods and their creations clashed, the echoes of battle reverberated through the lands, marking the beginning of an era defined by strife and ambition. The **First Great War** had begun, and the fate of Yonia hung in the balance.
