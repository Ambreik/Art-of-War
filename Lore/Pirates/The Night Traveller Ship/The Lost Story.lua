		The Lost Story  
		
	Title: The Curse of the Dragon God

In the heart of the tumultuous seas, where the waves crashed against the jagged cliffs of the Middlean Islands, a legend was born. Captain Rock, once a revered 
commander in the human marine army, had turned his back on honor and duty of principles of marines and followed his ambitions to become known for the greatest 
captain of the seas, during the infamous siege of Lagooma Jungle territories. He seized the opportunity to escape with fifty loyal crew members aboard a precious 
crusader ship, the Crusader's Wrath'. For years, they thrived in the shadows of the islands, embracing the life of piracy. Under Captain Rock's fierce leadership, 
they became notorious for raiding merchant vessels and seizing military equipment, their names whispered in fear across the seas.

But the thrill of their newfound freedom came at a cost. As the war raged on, dark creatures emerged from the depths of the jungle of Dragon Isle, capturing the 
crew and dragging them into the abyss. In the midst of a fierce battle for survival, a curse was unleashed upon them—a dark magic that transformed Captain Rock and 
his remaining crew into wretched beings, neither alive nor dead. Now, as the moon hung high in the sky, casting an eerie glow over the cursed crew, Captain Rock 
stood at the helm of the Crusader's Wrath, a ship that had become a ghostly vessel of despair. His crew, once vibrant men, were now a ghastly sight—some reduced to 
mere bones, others with flesh hanging loosely from their decaying forms, and some having limbs of aquatic animals.

	### The Calm Before the Storm

The night was eerily calm, a stark contrast to the chaos that had unfolded just hours before. The crew of the Crusader's Wrath had just returned from a successful 
raid on a merchant ship, their holds filled with gold and supplies. Laughter echoed across the deck as they celebrated their latest victory, unaware of the dark 
forces gathering on the horizon.
Captain Rock, however, felt a chill in the air. He stood at the ship's helm, his weathered hands gripping the wheel tightly. The moonlight illuminated his face, 
revealing the deep lines etched by years of hardship of being a pirate. He had once been a man of honor, but the life of piracy had changed him. The thrill of the 
chase and the taste of freedom had become intoxicating, yet a nagging sense of foreboding lingered in his mind.

Captain, you look troubled, said Commander Morgan Toothless, a burly man with a heart of gold. He approached Rock, concern etched on his face. We’ve just made a fortune! Why not enjoy it
Rock sighed, his gaze fixed on the horizon. It’s not the gold that worries me. It’s what lies beyond those cliffs. I can feel it in my bones.
Morgan followed his captain's gaze, squinting into the darkness. You mean Dragon Isle The tales of the Dragon God are just that—tales. We have nothing to fear.
But Rock knew better. The stories of the Dragon God, a dark creature said to rule over the island with an iron fist, were whispered among sailors and feared by all.
It was said that he commanded legions of minions—twisted beings that thrived in darkness and chaos. Rock had always dismissed these tales as mere superstition, but 
now, with the weight of his past pressing down on him, he couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being watched.

	### The Ambush

As the night wore on, the crew's revelry continued, but Rock's unease grew. Suddenly, a thick fog rolled in from the sea, enveloping the ship in an eerie shroud. 
The laughter faded, replaced by an unsettling silence. The crew exchanged nervous glances, their instincts kicking in.
All hands on deck! Rock bellowed, his voice cutting through the fog. Prepare for anything!
The crew scrambled to their stations, their earlier merriment replaced by a palpable tension. Just as they readied themselves, a deafening roar echoed through the 
night, shaking the very timbers of the Crusader's Wrath. The sound was unlike anything they had ever heard—a primal, bone-chilling cry that sent shivers down their 
spines.
From the depths of the fog emerged a massive silhouette, its wings unfurling like dark sails against the moonlit sky. The Dragon God had arrived.
To arms! Rock shouted, drawing his sword as the creature descended upon them. The air crackled with dark energy, and the ship trembled beneath the weight of the 
beast.
The Dragon God landed on the deck with a thunderous crash, his scales glistening like obsidian. His eyes burned with an otherworldly fire, and his minions—twisted, 
shadowy figures—swarmed around him, their forms shifting and writhing like smoke.
Foolish mortals, the Dragon God hissed, his voice a low growl that reverberated through the air. You dare to trespass in my domain You will pay for your arrogance!

	### The Battle for Survival

The crew fought valiantly, but they were no match for the dark magic that surged from the Dragon God and his minions. Morgan swung his sword at one of the shadowy 
figures, but it merely dissolved into smoke before re-forming behind him. Panic spread among the crew as they realized the true nature of their foe.
Stay together! Rock shouted, rallying his men. We can’t let them divide us!
But the Dragon God was relentless. He unleashed torrents of fire and shadow, engulfing the deck in chaos. Crew members fell one by one, their screams echoing into 
the night as they were consumed by darkness. Rock fought with all his might, but he could feel the weight of despair pressing down on him.
In a desperate bid to save his crew, Rock charged at the Dragon God, his sword raised high. I will not let you take my men! he roared, but the creature merely 
laughed, a sound that sent chills down Rock's spine.
You are but a fleeting moment in my eternal reign, the Dragon God taunted. With a flick of his tail, he sent Rock sprawling across the deck, pain coursing through
his body.
As Rock struggled to rise, he saw Morgan fighting valiantly against a group of minions. The First Mate was surrounded, his back against the ship's railing. 
Captain! Help me! he shouted, desperation in his voice.
With renewed determination, Rock pushed himself to his feet and charged toward his friend. He fought through the haze of darkness, cutting down minions as he went. 
But just as he reached Morgan, the Dragon God unleashed a wave of dark energy that knocked them both to the ground.
You cannot win, the Dragon God sneered, his eyes glowing with malice. Your souls will be mine!

	### The Curse Unleashed

In that moment of despair, a dark magic surged through the air, enveloping the crew in a swirling vortex of shadows. Rock felt a cold grip around his heart as the 
curse took hold. The world around him faded, and he could hear the anguished cries of his crew as they were transformed into wretched beings.
When the darkness receded, Rock found himself standing on the deck of the Crusader's Wrath, but everything had changed. His body felt different—he was neither 
alive nor dead. He looked at his crew, and horror filled his heart. They were now grotesque shadows of their former selves, some reduced to mere bones, others with 
flesh hanging loosely from their decaying forms, and some having limbs of aquatic animals.

What have we become Morgan whispered, his voice barely recognizable.
We are cursed, Rock replied, his voice heavy with sorrow. We must find a way to break this spell.

The Dragon God loomed over them, a triumphant grin on his face. You are mine now, forever trapped in this wretched form. Your souls will serve me for eternity.

	### The Fight for Redemption

But Captain Rock was not one to surrender easily. Even in their cursed state, he felt a flicker of hope ignite within him. We may be cursed, but we are still pirates! he declared, rallying his crew. We will not bow to this monster!
With newfound determination, Rock led his crew into battle once more. They fought with a ferocity born from desperation, their cursed forms granting them strange 
abilities. Some could slip through shadows, while others could manipulate water, using it as a weapon against their foes.
The battle raged on, and as they fought, Rock began to understand the nature of their curse. It was not just a punishment; it was a test. They had to confront their
past sins and find redemption if they were to break free from the Dragon God's grasp.

Remember who we are! Rock shouted as they fought. We are not just pirates; we are brothers! We fought for each other once, and we will do so again!

As the crew rallied around their captain, they began to push back against the Dragon God and his minions. The tide of battle shifted, and for the first time, they 
felt a glimmer of hope.

	### The Final Confrontation

With the Dragon God momentarily distracted by the chaos, Rock seized the opportunity to confront him directly. You may have cursed us, but you will not break our spirit! he shouted, charging at the beast.
The Dragon God roared in anger, unleashing a torrent of fire. But Rock was ready. He called upon the strength of his crew, and together they formed a barrier of 
water that extinguished the flames.

You think you can defeat me the Dragon God bellowed, his eyes blazing with fury.
We are more than just men, Rock replied, his voice steady. We are a force to be reckoned with!

With a final surge of power, Rock and his crew launched a combined attack against the Dragon God. They channeled their anger, their pain, and their desire for 
freedom into a single strike. The air crackled with energy as they unleashed their magic upon the beast.
The Dragon God howled in rage as the attack struck true, sending him reeling back. The shadows that had once enveloped the crew began to dissipate, and they felt 
their forms shifting back to what they once were.

	### The Breaking of the Curse

As the Dragon God fell to the ground, defeated, a blinding light enveloped the crew. They felt warmth wash over them, and one by one, they began to transform back 
into their human forms. The curse was breaking.
Rock looked at his crew, now restored to their former selves. They were battered and bruised, but they were alive. The weight of their past sins still lingered, but
they had fought for each other and emerged victorious.
We did it! Morgan exclaimed, a wide grin spreading across his face. We defeated him!
But Rock knew that their journey was far from over. They had much to atone for, and the world still lay before them, filled with challenges and dangers. This is just the beginning, he said, determination shining in his eyes. We will make amends for our past and forge a new path.

As they sailed away from Dragon Isle, the sun began to rise on the horizon, casting a golden light over the waters. The crew of the Crusader's Wrath had been given 
a second chance, and they would not squander it, but this is what they was believing as a new life away from this curse, until next full moon ...

	### Epilogue A New Dawn

those in need and now they help travelers cross the Great Sea from one point to the next location in exchange for a special currency, obtained only when the 
Halloween Event - Terror of the Underworld Spirits”. To their curse, they realized soon after that they become those monstrous beings again once night falls and
