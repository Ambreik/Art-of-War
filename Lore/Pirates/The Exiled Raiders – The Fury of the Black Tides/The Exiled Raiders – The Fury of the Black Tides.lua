			The Exiled Raiders – The Fury of the Black Tides  

		Origins The Betrayers of the Second Great War  
	During the Second Great War, many officers and soldiers were assigned to guard critical supply routes that connected the warfront with essential strongholds 
across the seas. Among these routes, a crucial passage ran near Sunnymead Island, ferrying resources to a distant Middlean Islands outpost.  
	However, as the war escalated and the Old Gods emerged, many soldiers found themselves caught between certain death in battle and desertion. A particular group 
of officers—once highly esteemed members of the Royal Naval Command—abandoned their posts, either out of fear or the desire to save themselves from the war's 
devastation. These officers, once bound by honor, soon became pariahs, marked as traitors to the crown and sentenced to exile.  
	With no safe harbor, they turned to piracy, carving out a life of theft, deception,and bloodshed. Over generations, their descendants formed The Exiled Raiders,
a brutal pirate faction known for their merciless raids and relentless pursuit of treasure and vengeance.

		The Pirate Creed & Traits  
	The Exiled Raiders adhere to a twisted code of honor that values  
- Loyalty to the Crew – Betrayal within their ranks is punishable by death.  
- Destruction of Authority – They despise all forms of organized government, especially naval forces.  
- Superiority of the Sea – They believe no land-dweller is truly free, only those who claim the open waters.  
- Blood Debts – They hold grudges for generations, believing vengeance must be repaid in blood.  

	As the direct descendants of the original deserters, they continue the legacy of violence, believing that by pillaging the supply routes their ancestors once 
guarded, they are fulfilling an ancestral debt—proving their strength by taking what they once protected.
