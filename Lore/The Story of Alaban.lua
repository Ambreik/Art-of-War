			The Story of Alaban

	Long ago, after the "Bubbles of Magic" reformed parts of the world in Chapter 25, a mystical and hidden territory emerged, surrounded by towering mountains and 
scattered with rivers that poured from unseen sources deep within the peaks. This place, named "Alaban", was imbued with an unusual magic: a place that, while 
beautiful, carried a heavy, mysterious energy. Some say it was the echoes of old battles, others the lingering magic of ancient sorcerers; but all who set foot 
there felt the weight of its allure.

	Aranil" was the first to find refuge here. A warrior who once stood loyally among the ranks of the human armies, Aranil’s life took a drastic turn when he fell 
in love with someone his people deemed an enemy. Betraying his faction to save her life, Aranil became an outcast, marked as a traitor. Forced to flee, he wandered 
for months until he stumbled upon the hidden, untamed beauty of Alaban. Here, he found solitude and a place where he could live free from the scorn of his past 
allies.
	As time passed, word of Alaban spread among those who, like Aranil, were shunned by society—betrayers, deserters, and even those who simply sought a life free 
from the rigid constraints of factional loyalties. Drawn by Aranil’s vision of a sanctuary for the unwanted, many came to join him, forming the first settlements 
within Alaban’s borders. They built with what they had, creating homes hidden by forest canopies, fortifying cities within mountain passes, and weaving a society 
bound not by allegiance to any faction, but by survival, cunning, and strength.

		Aranil’s Legacy and the Formation of the Outlaws

	Aranil’s ideals took root, and over generations, Alaban grew into a well-established territory of the outcast, the cunning, and the strong. But the Outlaws’ 
society was anything but peaceful. Power struggles, loyalty tests, and internal rivalries became common as different groups of exiles sought control of their 
newfound homeland. The original settlers, those who had followed Aranil, became somewhat revered, their wisdom seen as essential to surviving Alaban’s trials.

	To this day, Aranil’s influence permeates Alaban’s culture. The "Outlaw" faction remains tied to his name, and new recruits endure harsh rites to prove 
themselves worthy of this life. His symbol—an intricately carved black dagger—can be found on banners, etched in stone, and carried as an emblem by those who remain
true to his original vision of strength through resilience and independence.
