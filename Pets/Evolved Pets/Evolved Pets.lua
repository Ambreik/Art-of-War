			Evolved Pets
			
	Evolved pets are evolved from "Normal" pets and for this reason have same specification and mechanics but more complex. The only major difference is that 
those pets are able to attack the target with hits, melee or ranged, depending of the type of the creature that they was before and also to perform skills not only
to share to their master some passives.
	An evolved pet cannot be summoned if a "Normal" pet is already called.
	
	They use "Emote System" and are active involved with their current actions.
	Once a "Normal Pet" evolve the model texture is changed, become bigger and add some other stuff such as an armor or effects around them.
