			Carrier Pets
			
	This class of pets is unique in "Pet System". Those pets are not tamed but can be purchased from variuos "NPC Events" or from "Item-Shop" at certain times only.
	Their unique ability is to provide an inventory for the players where they can store items such as "Potions" and "Food", "Runes", "Profession Items" etc. They 
cannot carry equipment or pieces of equipment. Also when their inventory is full they does not affect character movement speed.
	Can be called in same time with other pets, and they follow their master everywhere without restriction.
	Have no skills or passive but have their own "Emote" system which players cannot use it because they have own mechanics to express themself according with the 
situation.
	Those pets can be a wild beast, flying creature or mini versions of different monsters or NPCs. What make them different is the complex model of them that make
them unique such as carrying a bag on their back, carrying a sword and shield and so on. Also they can swim.
	Some of those have some specific passive skills, but thore are very rare to find : 
*increase movement speed (in certain)
*increse the time spend under water
*reduce the "Environment Affects".
