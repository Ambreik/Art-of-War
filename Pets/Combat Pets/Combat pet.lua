			Combat pet

	Combat pets are pets under the direct control of the player. Combat pets can be permanent or temporary, and most classes are able to summon one. Some combat pets 
have multiple abilities, while others have only a basic attack, but all share the basic pet commands, allowing the player to control their movement and behaviour. 
	Players can only have 1 combat pet active at any time, and summoning another will dismiss the current pet. Also they can cannot be summoned with a "Evolved Pet", 
"Exotic Pet" , "Normal Pet" or for "Vampire" case when a "Companion" is already called.

	Combat Pets are always tamed as a wild beast or reward from a "Chest" dropped by a "Boss".
	Each of the available Combat Pets has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as differing abilities according with the beast found in wildness.
	They can increse in level similar with characters and obtaining "Skill Points" used to increase their skill tree system. Also can be learned some extra skills, 
only available for "Rare" and "Epic" class.
	Use a similar system for emotes where they can show their affection or anger and can be quite intependent when the character is afk or not in a battle stance.
