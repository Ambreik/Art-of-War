			Companion
			
	Since Vampire reach level 5, their Teacher NPC send them in wildness to capture a certain type of pet that later become a great necessity and a loyal friend, 
who accompanies them at every moment throughout the game.
	They are able to engage in combats and attack the targets, applying different debbufs to it or offer various buffs to the owner. They act as a tank and Aggro
surrounding monsters or different targets leaving the Vampire to strike from back, securing easy exp or accomplish a quest.
	They are unique pets specific only for Vampires.
	
	Companions are originally wild animals that are tamed by Vampires and act as "Combat Pet" or "Evolved Pets" as they are able to participate active in combat 
helping the master (Vampire) by tanking , buffer, healer or partner.
	A short category of companions : 
*Beast Companion : can be any wildling animal that can be found in "World Game".
*Aquatic Companion : only a few aquatic animals can be tamed as "Companion" by "Vampires".
*Magic Companion : those can be obtained by reward or in some other circumstances.
*Undead Companion : those companions can be tamed only in "Underworld" but called out in any "Realm".
	Those companions are only a few comparing with all pets that are out there ready to be tamed as "Combat Pet" or "Normal Pets" that later will become 
"Evolved Pet" and those that are strictly for "Vampires" fall into certain classes such as : 
*Tanker : beasts that can become a companion tanker are animals or beasts that actually are able to become, such as "Bear".
*Striker : beasts that can become a companion striker are animals or beasts that actually are able to become, such as "Wolf".
*Healer : beasts that can become a companion healer are animals or beasts that actually are able to become, such as "Owl".
*Ranger : beasts that can become a companion tanker are animals or beasts that actually are able to become, such as "Bat".
