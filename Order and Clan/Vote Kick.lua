			Vote Kick

	The Vote Kick system is a tool used in "Order/Clan" where members vote against another member to be kicked out. 
	Using the Vote Kick feature too often will not allow a player to initiate a Vote Kick for 2 hours for the entire "Order/Clan" members.
	
		Mechanic
	Anyone in the "Order/Clan" can initiate a "Vote Kick." When someone wants to remove a player from their group, they right-click on the player's name in the 
"Order/Clan" UI, and selects "Vote to kick". A message window appears, prompting the initiating player to enter a reason for the kick. This reason is presented to 
the other members with the option to accept the reason and kick the player, or deny the reason and keep the player in the "Order/Clan". This message comes as pop-up 
to all online members wherever they are. All offline members are informed by this decision once they are online via message and they have to go to "Order/Clan" 
"News" option and choose. Members can refuse to vote aswell but the Leader have a decisive role before all members vote.
	Once a vote to kick a member out is done by a member of the "Order/Clan" , the once is informed by a message by system announcing him regarding the reason chosen
and also who initiate. In this scenario, the kicked player cannot access the store of the organisation at all even if he/she stored gold or items there. Although 
in a case where the decision is against he/she, all the stored goods come back via "Mail" after one hour being kicked out. All this goods have to be store at least 
one day before or 5 days, older than 5 days the system cannot count it and are lost. 
	Once the decision was made it will be open for 24hours time when all members have to vote or refuse to vote. When all was online and voted, the Leader must also 
to vote and the leader vote represent 40% and can also determine the future to a member. end
