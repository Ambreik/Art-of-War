*potions that give the same bonus or attribute, cannot be used again until the effect of the preview is gone (e.g. "Attack Speed Potion" once used, cannot be used 
again in the next 10 minutes until the effect of thefirst potion is gone, but if a higher "Attack Speed Potion" is used, can replace the effect of a lesser potion)
