			DROP  

	A "drop*"* is any item obtained from the environment, such as loot from enemy mobs, found items in chests, or specific quest items. Drops are also known as 
"loot".

		Quest Drop  
	A "quest drop" refers to items required for specific quests. There are different types of quest drops, each with unique rules for how and when players can loot 
them:  

- "Single Item Quest Drops" :  
  - These are items that drop as a single instance, such as a unique object or a named mob's head.  
  - All players in a group with the associated quest can loot one of the items when the mob is defeated.  

- "Collectible Quest Items" :  
  - For quests that require players to collect multiple items, only one player can loot each item from a mob at a time.  
  - Questholders can loot the item regardless of loot settings like Group Loot or Free For All if they have the quest in their Quest Log.  

- "Exclusive Quest Items" :  
  - Certain items can drop regardless of whether a player has the associated quest.  
  - These items often have alternate uses and are not soulbound, allowing them to be traded or sold.  

- "Quest Starters" :  
  - Some items can initiate quests when looted. Every group member can pick up this item, regardless of loot priority.  
  - Such items may have level requirements, and some can serve additional purposes beyond starting a quest.

- "Rarity" : Due to their rarity, world drops often fetch high prices, especially if they have desirable appearances.  
- "Creature-Specific" : Some world drops only drop from specific types of creatures.  
- "Unfarmable" : The drop rate is so low that world drops are usually impossible to farm directly.
