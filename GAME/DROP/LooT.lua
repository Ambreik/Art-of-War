			Loot in World Game

	In "World Game", "loot" refers to items or money that are obtained from mobs or containers (such as barrels, boxes, chests, etc.), as well as the act of 
acquiring these items (known as looting). Below are different scenarios and methods for looting in the game:

---

	Looting While Solo

- "Lootable Corpses": A lootable corpse emits a "glittering" effect, and the cursor will change to the "trade" cursor when hovering over it.
- "Looting Action" : Right-click on the corpse of the mob you just killed, and a loot window will pop up displaying any items the mob is carrying.
- "Autoloot" : Shift-right-click (or Command-click) automatically loots all items, excluding "Bind on Pickup" (BoP) items. If a BoP item is looted, the player is prompted to either accept (binding the item to them) or leave it on the corpse.
- "Looting Process" : Players can return to a corpse to loot any remaining items until it disappears.

	Looting While in a Party

- "Personal Loot" : 
  - The default loot system for group content. The game assigns a random item to players based on their specs, while others receive a specified amount of gold.
  - "Mount Drops" : Mounts can also be won via this method from bosses that drop them.
  - "Looting Process" : Items are retrieved by looting the corpse of the boss. Chat logs display who won the items, and loot is tradeable within the group (unless it’s an item level upgrade for the player).
  - "Push Loot" : Elite mob, Boss, or special boss items are "personal push loot" and are automatically added to the player's inventory, bypassing the need to directly loot the corpse.
  
- "Quest Loot" :
  - "Collecting Multiple Items" : For quests requiring multiple items, quest loot will drop from specific mobs. If a looter cannot collect the quest item (either not having the quest or already completing it), the item is Free-for-All (FFA) for other members who can still collect it.
  - "Unique Quest Items" : If a quest involves collecting a specific item from a specific mob (e.g., collecting the head of a mob), every group member can loot the quest item from the same corpse. Other loot from the mob follows the party loot setting.

	Looting in Battlegrounds

- Players can loot enemy corpses in battlegrounds.
- Looting an enemy corpse removes their insignia, forcing them to revive at the graveyard (or Citadel).
- Looting provides the player with a small sum of money.

	Other Loot Methods

- "Need it Up" : 
  - Players who cannot equip an item are automatically excluded from the "need" roll for that item. This feature is used in indoor areas (e.g., dungeons, instances) and ensures that only those who can equip the item have an opportunity to roll for it.
  
- "Master Loot" :
  - One designated party member (the leader) loots all corpses and distributes the items.
  - This method requires trust, as the Master Looter has the authority to distribute loot however they choose. It can also include a random roll for specific items.
  
- "Free-for-Al"l (FFA) :
  - Loot is first-come, first-serve, with no rolls involved. This setting is common in non-dungeon areas or when assisting other players.
  
- "Money Distribution" :
  - Gold from corpses is distributed as evenly as possible among party members, regardless of the loot system in use.

		Loot Options: Need, Greed, Disenchant, and Pass

- "Loot Rolling" : 
  - When an item is available for looting, players must roll for the item based on the loot system established by the party leader. The roll window displays a visual of the item, and players have the following options:
    - "Need" : Used when the item is an upgrade for the player’s spec. A random number is generated between 1 and 100, with the highest roll winning.
    - "Greed" : Used when a player wants the item for selling or sending to an alt. If no one rolls "Need," players can then roll "Greed."
    - "Disenchant" : Available if someone in the group has the Enchanting profession. Disenchanting produces dusts, essences, shards, or crystals, which are often worth more than the item itself.
    - "Pass" : If a player does not want the item, they can click to pass, forfeiting their chance to roll for it.
  
- "Roll Process" :
  - If multiple players roll the same number (e.g., two players both roll 56 for a Greed item), a secondary roll is performed to determine the winner.
  - If everyone passes on an item, it becomes freely lootable to anyone in the party.

- "Container Loot" :
  - Loot from containers (chests, food crates, etc.) is not subject to party loot settings. Any party member can loot from containers, regardless of the loot threshold set by the party.

- "Roll Timer" :
  - A shrinking timer appears during a roll. If it expires before the player selects an option, they will automatically pass on the item.

- "Bind on Pickup Items" : 
  - These items automatically bind to the player upon looting and cannot be traded or sold once equipped. Players should be careful with these items, as they are typically kept by the player who loots them.
