			Energy

	Energy" is the primary resource used by the "Ninja" and "Vampire" races in the "World Game". Energy regenerates at a fixed rate of "1 energy every decisecond" 
(i.e., every one-tenth of a second), both in and out of combat, and is generally capped at "100". This makes energy a very fast-regenerating, fast-depleting resource,
requiring careful management. Certain energy-using rotations may benefit from energy pooling to maximize efficiency.

		Pool Size, Regeneration Rate, and Energy Restoration
- "Pool Size and Regeneration" : The energy pool size and regeneration rate are constant and do not increase with character level. However, certain talents, abilities
or  items and equipment effects can affect the "energy regeneration rate" and "maximum energy". 
- "Haste" : Haste increases the energy regeneration rate, but its effects are minimal unless the player stacks a considerable amount of Haste. For example, 
regeneration increases by approximately "1 energy per second" for every "10% Haste".
  
	Certain abilities and effects can restore lost energy or allow for the free usage of abilities that would otherwise require energy, helping maintain energy levels
during extended combat or other demanding activities.

	Talents

- "Ninja" :
  - "Alertness" (Knight race): Increases maximum energy by "50" and energy regeneration rate by "10%" .
  - "Vitality" (Pindar race): Increases maximum energy by "50" and energy regeneration rate by "10%" .

- "Vampire" :
  - "Adrenaline" : Provides a base "15% chance" to hit twice, doubling the energy regeneration rate for "15 seconds" .
  - "Master of Shadows" : Grants "1 additional combo point" when certain abilities are used and prevents energy consumption if the target suffers "critical" or 
"penetrating damage".

	Consumables**

- "Grapes Juice" : Instantly restores "100 energy" on a "5-minute cooldown".
