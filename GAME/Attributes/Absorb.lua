			Absorb

	"Absorption" is a wide avoidance mechanic available to both NPCs and players. It is most commonly triggered by spells and items. Absorption allows a target to 
reduce the amount of damage they take by "absorbing" a portion of the incoming damage, preventing it from affecting their health pool.

	Absorption can be categorized into "general absorption" (which applies to all damage types) or "school-specific absorption" (which applies only to certain types 
of damage, such as fire, frost, or nature). The type of absorption may vary depending on the source of the effect.

	It's important to note that absorbing damage does not allow the player or NPC to avoid the "secondary effects" of a spell, such as "snares" or debuffs, 
except in the case of "pushback" effects, where absorption may prevent the physical displacement of the target.

		Mechanics and Applications
	Absorption is commonly found on armors through systems like "Bonus" or "Inner Core" mechanics, where certain pieces of gear grant a percentage or fixed amount of 
absorption. Additionally, "buffs" and "temporary effects" can also provide absorption, further enhancing a characterâ€™s defense during critical moments.

	Absorption acts as a complementary defense mechanic alongside "damage reduction" and "damage mitigation". However, it does not replace them; instead, it works 
together to reduce the total amount of incoming damage.
