			Resource Pooling

	"Resource pooling" is an advanced tactic used primarily by non-mana classes to maximize the effectiveness of their abilities during a limited-time bonus effect.
The goal is to have the maximum amount of resources—whether "rage", "energy", or "focus"—available when the bonus is active, enabling the player to unleash multiple
abilities in quick succession, thus benefiting from the bonus.

	This strategy is usually employed by players who have already mastered their specialization's basic ability rotation and wish to push their effectiveness even 
further. It can be considered a form of "stacking" beneficial effects, but in this case, the effect being "stacked" is the accumulation of resources to rapidly use 
abilities.

	While "damage dealers" benefit most from resource pooling, "tanks" generally aren't concerned with spamming abilities, and "healers" usually have large mana 
pools that negate the need for pooling.

		Applicability**
	Abilities and effects can be categorized by their "synergy" with other abilities and their "uptime", both of which determine the effectiveness of resource 
pooling. Personal buffs, raid buffs, enemy debuffs, or encounter-specific mechanics can all be considered "buffs" for resource pooling, as long as they increase the
potency of abilities. 

	However, in some cases, pooling may not be practical due to the specialization's rotation being too complex or having higher priority concerns.

	Some abilities, such as simple direct damage, don’t interact with other abilities and thus don’t require resource pooling. However, they may still be affected 
by other abilities that benefit from pooling, especially when these abilities allow for standalone attacks to be used more rapidly.

		Usage
	In practice, due to factors like "reaction time", "lag", and the "global cooldown", it is generally not feasible to wait until the resource pool is at the 
absolute maximum, especially if the resource regenerates quickly. Any delay past the cap would result in wasted resources. Instead, players typically aim for a 
"soft cap"—keeping the resource pool just shy of the maximum (about 1-1.5 seconds worth of resources remaining) to avoid wasting them.

	"Energy pooling" is most effective when the player has control over the timing of the buff, such as through an ability or on-use item. However, it can also be 
employed in response to random or timed events.

	Here are some examples of how to pool resources:

- For an on-use ability : Players can use the ability when they reach the "soft cap."
- For a random effect : The player first reaches the target soft cap, uses a low-cost ability (depending on the class), and then waits to reach the cap again, repeating this process until the desired effect triggers and the resources can be "unloaded."
- For a timed effect : Players need to estimate when the high-damage phase of a boss encounter or their ability's cooldown will occur and begin pooling resources early enough to reach the cap at the optimal moment.
- Coordination with raid buffs is often helpful in maximizing the effectiveness of pooling.

		Other Resources
	Mana-using classes generally don’t need to worry about resource pooling because their mana pool is designed to sustain them throughout an encounter. However, if
a mana-using class runs low on mana, a similar approach to resource pooling may be applied. Rather than casting spells as soon as any mana becomes available, it may
be beneficial to wait until enough mana is accumulated to cast multiple spells, allowing positive interactions between them and ensuring more efficient mana usage.

		Other Meanings	
	Resource pooling can also refer to situations where resources naturally accumulate without the player intending to "save" them for a large expenditure. For 
example, players may intentionally reserve resources to use when a random effect grants a charge of an ability or when an ability’s cooldown ends. Unlike full 
resource pooling, the objective here is not to maximize resources but to keep enough available for the anticipated abilities.

	It’s also possible for players to "unintentionally" pool resources if a combination of cooldowns, random effects, or fight conditions prevents them from using 
resources. This may look like strategic pooling, but unless the player is lucky enough to have an applicable ability ready to take advantage of the buildup, the 
resources will likely be wasted when the player hits the cap.
