			Intelligence

	Intelligence Overview : 
- "Intelligence" (INT) is a secondary stat for certain classes and primarily impacts "magical abilities", "spell damage", and "magical defense". It also improves 
"magic attack" and enhances the character's ability to counter magical attacks.

	INT Effects : 
1. Mana and Magic Effects : 
   - "MP Increase" :  Each point of "INT" increases the character's mana pool by "20 MP".
   - "Magic Attack" :  Each point of "INT" increases "Magic Attack" by "1.5 points".
   - "Magic Defense" :  INT increases "Magic Defense" by "1 point" per INT.
   - "Magical Ability Power" :  INT boosts the effectiveness of "magical abilities", particularly for "Warlocks" and "Shaman" classes.

2. Physical Attack : 
   - "Shaman" and "Warlocks" benefit from INT increasing their "physical attack" (approximately "1.6 points of attack" for each point of INT).
   - "Warlocks", "Werewolves", and "Vampires" also see boosts to their physical attack power via INT.

3. Buffs and Enhancements : 
   - INT enhances the "effectiveness of buffs" and "magical enhancements" for "Warlocks", "Werewolfs", and "Shaman" characters.
   
4. Max Value : 
   - As with other stats, "INT" cannot exceed "90 points".

	Starting INT Values : 
- Each class has its own "base INT" when starting:
  - Ninja (both classes) :  3
  - Warrior (both classes) :  3
  - Warlock Necromancer :  6
  - Warlock :  5
  - Shaman (both classes) :  6
  - Werewolf :  2
  - Vampire :  2

	Horse Bonus : 
- When riding a horse, the base INT value is adjusted by the mount’s level:
  - Novice Horse (level 1) :  9 INT
  - Armored Horse (level 11) :  13 INT
  - Assault Horse (level 21) :  18 INT
  - Legendary Horse :  25 INT
  - INT Base Increase :  If your "base INT" is lower than the horse’s level bonus, the stat will be raised to the minimum value provided by the mount. This affects 
"Magic Attack" and "Magic Defense" but not "MP".

	Increasing Intelligence : 
- "INT" can be increased through various methods:
  - Items with an "INT" bonus
  - Food, drinks, or potions that increase INT
  - Bonus INT from items or equipment
  - "Inner System" may also have an impact on INT.

	Summary : 
"INT" plays a crucial role for magical and hybrid classes, particularly those focused on "spellcasting" and "magical defense". It enhances "mana" (MP), 
"magic attack", "magic defense", and "physical attack" for specific classes like "Shaman" and "Warlocks". As characters progress, INT becomes a key attribute to 
maximize in certain builds, particularly for "Warlocks", "Werewolves", and "Shamans".
