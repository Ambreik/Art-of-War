			Health (HP)

	Health Overview :
- Health (HP), also known as "hit points", represents the life level of all creatures in the game.
  - Player Characters : When a player's HP reaches zero, they die.
  - NPCs : NPC health is predefined by game developers, with raid bosses having the highest health and "trash mobs" having the lowest.

	Health Determination :
- Player Health :
  - The maximum health for player characters is determined by a combination of:
    - Character Level : Health increases as players level up.
    - Vitality (VIT) : Vitality directly influences HP, increasing it by 40 units per VIT point.
  - Class Variance : 
    - "Tanks" tend to have the largest amounts of health.
    - "Healers" and "Damage Dealers" have comparatively lower health.
  
- NPC Health :
  - Raid bosses have the highest health.
  - "Trash mobs" (less significant NPCs) have the least health.

	Health Buffs :
- Certain "buffs" (temporary or permanent) can increase the maximum health of a character, with some classes having specific abilities to boost health.

	Health Modifications :
- Items and Enchants :
  - Some items, especially older ones, provide passive bonuses to "maximum health".
  - Low-level "enchants" can also provide health increases.

	Health Recovery :
- Out of Combat Recovery :
  - All players have an innate health replenishment rate when out of combat based on character level.
  - "Food", "drinks", and "health potions" can boost health regeneration, with effects varying depending on the item.
  
- In Combat Recovery :
  - Health does not replenish naturally while in combat.
  - Players can restore health through "healing", "herbalist drinks", and "potions" available from vendors or dropped by monsters.
  - Certain "talents" or abilities can replenish health both in and out of combat.

- NPC Health Recovery :
  - NPCs that despawn or travel too far from their spawn point will recover their health fully once they retreat back to their starting location.

	Base Health :
- "Base Health" for players is primarily determined by "Vitality".
  - This value can then be modified by additional factors such as:
    - "Talents"
    - "Stamina"
    - "Enchants"
    - "Item Effects"

	Key Takeaways for Gameplay :
- "Tanks" will benefit most from maximizing health, while "damage dealers" and "healers" typically have lower health.
- Health management is crucial for survival, with in-combat recovery dependent on potions and abilities, while out-of-combat recovery happens naturally over time.
- Items, buffs, and talents can modify health, and players can further enhance their "HP" using these systems.
