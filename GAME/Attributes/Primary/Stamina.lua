			Stamina

	Stamina Overview : 
- "Stamina" is a standalone status that is "automatically increased" as the player character levels up.
- It serves as the primary resource for "movement" and greatly impacts "traveling" across the world.

	Stamina Mechanics : 
1. Regeneration : 
   - Stamina regenerates while moving, but certain shoes in the game may provide a bonus to stamina regeneration, referred to as "Stamina REGEN".
   - This bonus "increases stamina regeneration" by a specific percentage while the player is moving.
   
2. Inventory Influence : 
   - The amount of inventory space used affects how fast stamina regenerates:
     - First inventory page :  Causes "2% slower regeneration".
     - Two inventory pages full :  Causes "12% slower regeneration".
   
3. In Combat : 
   - When in "combat stance", stamina "does not regenerate" or decrease. It "remains static" until the player dies or begins moving again.

4. Depletion : 
   - If stamina reaches 0, the player must "walk" (instead of running) to allow stamina to regenerate back to "100%".
   - If the playerâ€™s "inventory is full", it will "increase the regeneration time".

	Key Takeaways : 
- "Stamina" directly impacts a character's movement speed and travel efficiency.
- "Shoes" and inventory management can influence how quickly stamina regenerates.
- "Stamina REGEN" bonuses help increase movement stamina recovery.
- "In combat", stamina remains constant, and players cannot regenerate it unless they stop fighting and begin moving again.
