			Vitality (VIT)

	Vitality Overview :
- Primary Role : Vitality (VIT) directly affects the "Health" (HP) and "Defense" (ACC) of characters. It is a key status attribute for all players, NPCs, monsters, 
and pets in the game.
- Key Features :
	- Health (HP) : Vitality increases max HP by 40 units for each point of VIT.
	- Defense (ACC) : Increases defense by 3 points for every 4 points of VIT.
	- Magic Defense : Every 3 points of VIT increase Magic Defense by 1 unit.
	- Ability Power : Increases ability power by 5 points per VIT.
	- Physical Attack : Increases physical attack for Werewolf and Vampire by 1 per VIT.
	- Healing Effects : Boosts healing effectiveness during combat and regeneration of health.

	Class-Specific Vitality :
Each class has its own base Vitality (VIT) value upon starting:
- Ninja (both classes): 3
- Warrior Arahan : 4
- Warrior Tank : 8
- Warlock Necromancer : 3
- Warlock : 4
- Shaman Healer : 4
- Shaman Dragon : 3
- Werewolf : 6
- Vampire : 3

	Horse Bonuses :
- Vitality increases when riding horses, with different horses providing different bonuses based on their level:
	- Novice Horse (Level 1) : +18 VIT
	- Armed Horse (Level 11) : +30 VIT
	- Assault Horse (Level 21) : +36 VIT

	- If a player's base VIT is lower than the horse's provided value, they will receive a "Defense" (ACC) increase instead of Health.

	- Maximum HP** can be increased by +500, +1000, or +2000.
	- Percentage-based HP** increases can also apply.
