			Mana

	Mana Overview : 
- "Mana" (or "Energy Source") is a core resource that reflects a character's available energy for casting spells and applying abilities.
- "Mana Bar" :  It is represented by a "blue mana bar", displayed next to the health bar. Players start with a full mana bar, which depletes as spells and abilities
are cast.

	Mana Mechanics : 
1. Mana Consumption : 
   - Each "spell" or ability consumes mana, with more powerful spells requiring more mana.
   - Spell Costs :  Some spells may have their mana cost reduced based on the spell level, often up to "50" of the base cost (with some exceptions).
   - If mana runs low, expensive spells will be temporarily disabled until enough mana is regenerated.

2. Mana Regeneration : 
   - Innate Regeneration :  Characters naturally regenerate mana over time.
   - Combat vs. Out of Combat :  Mana regeneration is reduced during combat but can be boosted with items like "mana potions", magical items, or certain "buffs".
     - Out of combat, mana regeneration can be increased significantly, especially with special **mana drinks**.
   - Combat Regen :  In combat, mana regeneration is based on a "base regen value" and any additional bonuses. 

3. Mana Pool vs. Base Mana : 
   - "Base Mana" refers to the mana a character has before any modifiers.
   - "Mana Pool" is the total mana a player has, including all modifications from buffs, items, etc. It can be **up to five times** the base mana for certain 
classes or specializations, but itâ€™s usually fixed by level.
     - Pure Caster Classes :  For these classes, "Base Mana" and "Mana Pool" are the same.

4. Out of Mana : 
   - If a player runs out of mana, they receive a system message :   
   "<System Message>: You are out of mana. Cannot perform any skill at the moment."  
   A verbal comment is also issued to nearby players, indicating that the character is low or out of mana.

5. Bosses and Mana Draining : 
   - Many "elite monsters" or "bosses" have abilities that "drain mana", leaving the character completely drained in battle.

6. Mana Cost Reduction : 
   - With enough points in skills, certain abilities may have their mana cost reduced to "zero", making them free to use.

	Additional Details : 
- "Mana Pool" affects the interpretation of spell costs, which are usually quoted as a percentage of "Base Mana", not necessarily the "Mana Pool".

	Mana Regeneration in Combat : 
- Combat Regen :  While in combat, mana regenerates at a reduced rate. This regen is influenced by:
  - "Base Combat Regen" value
  - Any "bonus regen" granted by buffs, items, or other mechanics.

- Out of Combat :  Mana regeneration is fully restored, combining the "Combat Regen" and "Energy Regen" values.

	Class-Specific Notes : 
- "Pure Casters" have a direct relationship between "Base Mana" and "Mana Pool". Their mana pool is typically equal to their base mana, or up to "400% greater".
- "Non-Casters" or hybrid classes may have a lower mana pool and mana regeneration but can still access mana-related skills and items.
