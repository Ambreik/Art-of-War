			Strength (STR)

	Strength Overview :
- "Strength" (STR) is a secondary stat for certain classes, primarily affecting "melee damage" and "physical attacks". 
  - It increases "average damage" and "damage for physical attack skills".

	Effects of Strength :
1. "Physical Attack Value" :
   - "STR" boosts the "physical attack" of the character, except for certain classes like "Werewolfs" and "Shaman".
   - Specific increases:
     - "Warriors" and "Warlocks" : Attack increases by 2 per STR point.
     - "Ninja" : Attack increases by 1 per 4 STR points.
   
2. "Damage of Physical Abilities" :
   - STR enhances the damage of physical abilities, particularly for:
     - "Warriors"
     - "Ninjas" 
     - "Warlocks" 

3. "Buff Abilities" :
   - "Strength" boosts the effectiveness of some buff abilities.

	Class-Specific STR Details :
- STR is essential for "Warriors", often being the first or second stat they focus on.
- Assassins, Vampires, and Warlocks tend to prioritize STR as their third maxed stat.
  
	Base STR Values by Class :
Each class has a different starting value for STR:
- Ninja Assassin : 4
- Ninja Archer : 3
- Warrior Arahan : 6
- Warrior Tank : 4
- Warlock Necromancer : 3
- Warlock : 5
- Shaman (both classes) : 3
- Werewolf : 2
- Vampire : 3

	STR Limitations :
- STR cannot exceed "90 points", similar to other stats in the game.

	Horse Bonuses :
- When riding a horse, the **minimum STR** values for different horses are:
  - Novice Horse (Level 1) : 26 STR
  - Average Horse (Level 11) : 40 STR
  - Assault Horse (Level 21) : 53 STR
  - Legendary Horse : 70 STR
- If a player's **base STR** is higher than the minimum required by the horse, the bonus from the horse will not increase further.

	Ways to Increase Strength :
- Items with STR bonuses can increase STR.
- Food, drinks, or potions can provide STR boosts.
- "Inner System" may also influence STR.

	Key Takeaways :
- "STR" is a key stat for physical damage, particularly for classes like "Warriors" and "Warlocks".
- It influences both base attack and the damage of "physical abilities".
- The "STR" stat can be further modified by items, food, potions, and the "Inner System".
- "STR" has a cap at "90 points", and the stat is often crucial for classes that rely on "melee combat".
