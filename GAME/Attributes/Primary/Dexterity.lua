			Dexterity

	Dexterity Overview:
- Primary Role : Increases melee and ranged attack power, affects Average Damage, Skill Damage, and Dodge value.
- Dodge : Every 3rd point increases Dodge by 1 (up to 90 DEX, then at every 5th point after that).
- Damage & Skill Impact :
  - Increases Average Damage and Skill Damage (particularly for certain classes like Ninjas and Vampires).
  - Increases attack power (based on the weapon/equipment, up to a max factor of x2).
  - Damage reduction: Dexterity also contributes to damage resistance in a way independent of Dodge.
  
	Detailed Mechanics:
- Dodge Value :
	- Each 3rd point of Dexterity increases Dodge by 1, with diminishing returns after 90 DEX.
	- Max Dodge : 30 Dodge with 90 DEX, but additional bonuses can push it beyond that (with increasing difficulty).
  
- Damage Reduction :
	- DEX decreases damage taken independently of Dodge (approx. 0.3-0.4% damage reduction per DEX point, with a peak at DEX 80-115).
	- This reduction is non-linear and can vary based on the attackerâ€™s DEX.

- Weapon & Equipment :
	- Increases the attack value of weapons and equipment, including any items or bonuses that are inserted into gear.
	- The effect depends on the character level, with fewer DEX points needed for the max bonus at higher levels.

- Class-Specific Impact :
	- Classes that benefit most : Ninjas, who prioritize DEX for their abilities.
	- Initial DEX values : Different starting DEX based on the class:
		- Ninja (both): 6
		- Warrior: 3
		- Warlock: 3
		- Shaman (both): 3
		- Werewolf: 4
		- Vampire: 6

- Horse Bonuses :
	- When mounted, the horse provides a minimal bonus to Dexterity, which scales with the level of the mount.
	- Horse Dexterity Bonuses : Novice Horse (25), Armored Horse (38), Assault Horse (51), Legendary Horse (68).
  
- Ways to Increase Dexterity :
	- Items : Items with a DEX bonus or bonus DEX on equipped gear.
	- Consumables : Food, drinks, potions that enhance DEX.
	- Inner System : Can also be influenced by the Inner System.
