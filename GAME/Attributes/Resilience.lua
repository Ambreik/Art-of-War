			Resilience

	Resilience" (also known as "Crowd Control (CC) Reduction") is an attribute that reduces the duration of all incoming crowd control effects, except for 
"airborne", "disarm", "knocked back/pulled", "rooted", and "suppressed" effects.

	Mechanics :
- "Base Value" : Every character starts with a "resilience value of 5" upon creation.
- "Maximum Resilience" : A character can have a maximum of **49 resilience**, and any resilience value above this has no effect.
- "Effect on Crowd Control Duration" : Resilience is inversely proportional to the duration of crowd control effects. The formula to calculate the total crowd control
(CC) duration is:

  \[
  \text{Total CC Duration} = \text{Initial CC Duration} \times (100\% - \text{Total Resilience})
  \]

  - The duration cannot be decreased below "0.1 seconds".

	Stacking Resilience
- "Acquisition" : Resilience does not increase with character level like other stats but can be increased through items such as armor and necklaces. It is considered a **Rare Bonus** and can be found randomly on these items.
- Item Level Requirement : Resilience can only be found on items level 20 and higher and cannot be added via enchants.
  
	Items that Provide Resilience :
- "Tough Boots" : Provides +10 Resilience.
- "Stone Potion" : Grants +15 Resilience for 120 minutes.

	Other Effects
- Proportional to CC Duration : For every 1 point of Resilience, the duration of crowd control effects is reduced by "0.1 seconds".
