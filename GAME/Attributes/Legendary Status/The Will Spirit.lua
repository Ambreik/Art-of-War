			The Will Spirit

	Once you unlock your first "Champion" or "Legend" level, you will gain access to four new stats that make up the "Spirit’s Willpower". These stats are:

- "Spirit Will (STR)"
- "Spirit Will (VIT)"
- "Spirit Will (RES)"
- "Spirit Will (INT)"

	These stats increase similarly to the base stats (VIT, INT, STR, DEX), but their effects are tied to specific map thresholds. If your "Spirit Will" availability
is below the required amount for a particular area, you will face various penalties.

	Spirit Will Penalties Based on Map and Enemy's Spirit Will

1. "Spirit Will (STR)" – Reduced Attack Damage
   - If your "Spirit Will (STR)" threshold is not reached for the map, your attack damage against monsters and bosses is reduced. 
   - "Example" : If your attack normally deals 10,000 damage and you don’t meet the required "Spirit Will (STR)" for the map, your damage will be halved. In this case, you will only deal 5,000 damage with the same attack on the monster.

2. "Spirit Will (VIT) – Reduced HP"
   - If your "Spirit Will (VIT)" is below the required threshold, your HP is reduced.
   - "Example" : If your HP is normally 30,000 and you don’t meet the required "Spirit Will (VIT)", your HP will be halved, leaving you with only 15,000 health.

3. "Spirit Will (RES) – Reduced Movement Speed"
   - If your "Spirit Will (RES)" is below the required threshold, your movement speed is reduced.
   - "Example" : If your normal movement speed is 200 and you don’t have the necessary "Spirit Will (RES)" for the map, your movement speed will be halved, leaving you with only 100 movement speed.

4. "Spirit Will (INT) – Reduced Sensitivity (Resistance to Status Effects)"
   - If your "Spirit Will (INT)" is below the required threshold, your resistance to status effects (poison, slow, bleed, etc.) is reduced.
   - "Example" : If you normally have high resistance to status effects and your "Spirit Will (INT)" is not high enough for the map, you will be more vulnerable to these effects.

	Additional Notes: 
- Higher Spirit Willpower than Required : Having "Spirit Willpower" higher than the required threshold will not grant any additional bonuses. It simply prevents penalties.
  
- Penalties in Specific Maps : In certain areas, specific objectives must be completed to cancel out the penalties caused by low "Spirit Willpower".

- Where the Debuff Applies : This penalty only applies when you are outside the cities or human settlements of the new continent (Legrand). 
Within human settlements, the debuff does not apply.

		Unlocking "Wild Spirit Status"

	The "Wild Spirit" status is unlocked in "Expansion III" once the "Legrand" continent is implemented. As players enter this new continent, they must raise their 
"Spirit Will" stats for each area, in addition to their regular base stats. This system is intended to enhance gameplay complexity and provide additional challenges
as players explore and battle in the new regions.
