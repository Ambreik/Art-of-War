			Avoidance**

	"Avoidance" refers to a "Guardian" or "Baron" ability to completely nullify certain attacks. There are different forms of avoidance for various types of attacks:

1. "Melee Attacks" : 
   - "Dodge" : This allows the Guardian or Baron to completely evade a melee attack, preventing any damage from being dealt.
   - "Miss" : If the attacker fails to hit the target, the attack is completely avoided.

2. "Spells" : 
   - "Resistance" : This increases the chance of completely avoiding a spell attack. High resistance can make it possible for the Guardian or Baron to fully avoid the
effects of certain magic-based attacks.

	Avoidance vs. Mitigation

- "Avoidance" should not be confused with "mitigation". Mitigation refers to the partial reduction of an attack's damage (e.g., through effects like armor or block). 
Avoidance, on the other hand, eliminates the attack entirely. For example, "block" and "armor" cannot contribute to avoidance, but they play a significant role in 
mitigating damage.
  
	Avoidance and Area of Effect (AoE) Attacks

- Avoidance slightly reduces the damage taken from "Area of Effect" (AoE) attacks. While it cannot entirely negate AoE damage, it can lower the total damage dealt by 
these types of attacks.

	Avoidance Enhancement with Guardian or Baron Level

- The "Avoidance" status is enhanced based on the "level" of the "Guardian" or "Baron". As the Guardian or Baron levels up, their ability to avoid attacks improves, 
making them more resilient against various types of damage.
