			Rage

	"Rage" is the primary resource used by certain classes in the "World Game" to activate their most powerful skill, known as the "Ultimate Skill" 
(or "Ultimate"). By controlling and focusing their Rage, players can unleash devastating attacks, fortify themselves as unassailable defenders, or even draw 
strength and healing from their anger.

- Rage Bar Mechanics : By default, the Rage bar starts empty. When out of combat, Rage drains or depletes at a constant rate.Rage is affected by "level" or "stats",
with a common mechanic being "BONUS Rage" found on items. This bonus typically increases with a few points until reaching level 100. Rage is capped at "100" at 
level 20 but increases by "5" per level up to a maximum of "500" at higher levels.

- Rage Generation : Rage can be generated in a number of ways, some passive and some active. A number of abilities and talents affect the generation and usage of 
Rage. Most talents and abilities reduce the Rage cost of certain actions, while others offer additional opportunities to generate it.

		Basic Rage Generation
	Rage generation can occur through various means, depending on the class:

- Passive Abilities : For example, abilities like "Boiling Blood" regenerate Rage at an accelerated rate (4% faster than normal).
  
- Being Attacked : Players can generate "1 Rage" for every "7 hits received" in combat (PvM or PvP). This mechanic applies to all classes except the "Vampire" in 
"flying form", which does not generate Rage in this way.

		Other Sources of Rage Generation

- Equipment :
  - Level 55 Earring : Grants "5% Rage regeneration" as a standard bonus for each quality level up to +6.
  - Level 100 Bracelet : Grants "1% Rage regeneration", which increases up to "9" at quality level +9.

- Consumables :
  - Great Rage Potion : Instantly generates "20 Rage".
  - Mighty Flask of Rage : Instantly generates "half of the player's total Rage".

		Rage Decay
	Rage decays at a rate of "1.25 per second" while the player is out of combat. It is not possible to maintain a constant Rage value outside of combat, so itâ€™s 
more important to bank Rage during combat. This is especially useful during transitions between encounters, such as while waiting for the group to recover or moving
between enemies.

	Maintaining Rage is often more crucial during the combat phase, particularly for boss fights or when facing a group of enemies. Having a full Rage bar before an
encounter provides a head start in dealing damage or boosting defenses.

- Debuffs : Certain "Debuffs" from monsters throughout the "World Game" can reduce or prevent Rage generation, retention, or usage for a period of time. 
For example, a debuff may:
  - Prevent Rage from being used
  - Block Rage regeneration
  - Disrupt the player's ability to build or maintain Rage
