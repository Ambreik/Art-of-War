			Cast Time

	"Cast Time" is the duration required to activate a spell or ability before it takes effect. This mechanic is essential in determining how quickly abilities can 
impact gameplay, especially in combat, where timing and interruption play a critical role. Abilities are categorized based on how they handle cast time:

	Categories of Abilities by Cast Time

1. "Instant" : These abilities take effect immediately upon activation, without any cast time.
	- Characteristics : 
		- Cannot be interrupted.
		- Less predictable, making them difficult to counter in PvP.
	- Examples : Instant spells are common in abilities that are crucial in quick-response situations.

2. "Cast-Time" : Abilities that require a visible casting period before taking effect.
	- Characteristics : 
		- Display a cast bar that fills up before the spell activates. The cast bar is yellow initially and turns green when casting completes.
		- Can be interrupted by damage or other abilities, causing the spell to fail if the cast bar fills with red.
		- Susceptible to pushback, where incoming damage can slow the casting speed.
	- Classes and Examples :
		- Shaman Dragon
		- Ninja Archer
		- Warlock Sorcerer
		- Warrior Tank (e.g., "Body Strengthening" skill)
		- Warrior Arahan (e.g., "Berserk" skill)
	- Monsters :
		- Some regular monsters, elites, and bosses.

3. "Channeled" : Abilities that start immediately but deliver their effect in periodic intervals, known as "ticks," over the channeling duration.
	- Characteristics : 
		- Begins instantly, with damage or healing applied in intervals.
		- Damage taken during the channeling can shorten the spell but does not delay its intervals as in cast-time spells.
		- Typically classified as periodic effects, such as **damage over time (DoT)** or **heal over time (HoT)** spells.
	- Classes and Examples :
		- Shaman Dragon
		- Warlock Sorcerer
	- Monsters :
		- Regular and elite monsters, bosses, and elite bosses.

	Cast Time Modifiers
- "Spell Haste" : Reduces the casting duration of non-instant abilities, also reducing the global cooldown. 
- "Pushback" : Incoming melee attacks and direct damage delay cast-time spells, increasing the cast duration.
- "Interruptions" : Some abilities or actions fully interrupt casting, causing the cast bar to fill with red and indicate "Interrupted."

	Additional Mechanics

- Mana Consumption : 
	- For cast-time spells, mana is only consumed upon successful casting.
	- Instant and channeled spells consume mana immediately upon activation.
  
- Self-Interrupt : Players may cancel their own spell casting by moving, jumping, or pressing the Escape key.

- Special Abilities : Certain talents and skills reduce casting time, grant instant casts, or prevent interruption for key spells, which can be strategically 
advantageous in both PvE and PvP scenarios.

	"Cast time" plays a significant role in the pacing and strategy of "World Game", balancing between the immediacy of instant abilities and the strategic 
vulnerability of cast-time and channeled spells. Let me know if you'd like to explore specific mechanics for certain classes or effects!
