			Defense (or ACC)

	"Defense" is a key secondary attribute in "World Game", contributing to damage mitigation and overall survivability by reducing the damage taken from enemy 
attacks. The "Defense" value of a player is determined by their equipment and Vitality (VIT) bonus, forming a crucial part of combat effectiveness, especially for 
tanking classes.

		Calculating Defense

	The "base Defense" value for any player is derived from the following formula:
- "Defense" = Level + Vitality + Equipment

This formula takes into account a character's level and Vitality (VIT), as well as the defense stats from the following gear items:
- "Helmet"
- "Armor"
- "Boots"
- "Shield"

	Defense Mechanics and Effects

1. "Physical Damage Reduction" : Defense lowers the amount of incoming physical damage and the likelihood of taking critical hits.
   
2. "Block and Dodge" : Higher Defense can increase the probability of successfully blocking or dodging attacks, essential for melee survival.
   
3. "Critical Hit Immunity" for Tank Classes : 
   - Knights : Can activate the [Protection Aura] skill to become immune to critical hits from enemies, enhancing tanking effectiveness.
   - Pindars : Can use the [Defensive Stance] skill for similar protection, making them resilient to critical strikes.

4. "Defense Abilities" by Class :
   - Warlock Necromancer : The [Dark Protection] skill reduces damage intake and diverts part of the damage to SP consumption, helping sustain health.
   - Shaman Healer : The [Enchanted Armour] support skill reflects close-combat damage, providing a unique defense mechanism in close-quarters combat.

		Importance of Defense

	For tank classes and players seeking durability, Defense is indispensable for managing damage intake and resisting critical strikes. This attribute becomes 
particularly valuable in high-difficulty PvE encounters and PvP scenarios, where mitigation can make the difference in survival and performance.
