			Mana Regeneration

	Mana regeneration refers to a game character's ability to regain mana points over time. This process differs based on whether the player is in combat or out of 
combat.

- "Out of Combat" : Players regenerate their full mana regen amount faster when they avoid using abilities that consume mana in a short period.
  
- "In Combat" : Mana regeneration occurs at a slower rate while in combat. However, certain items with the "Chance to Steal SP" effect can significantly boost the 
speed of mana regeneration, allowing players to regain mana much faster during combat.
