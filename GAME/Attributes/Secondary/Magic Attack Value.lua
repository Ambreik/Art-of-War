			Magic Attack Value

	"Magic Attack Value" (MAV) is a critical attribute that directly boosts the effectiveness of spells, influencing both damage dealt by offensive spells and healing
from restorative spells.

		Calculating Magic Attack Value

	The base formula for Magic Attack Value, before applying bonuses, is:
- "Level + Intelligence + Magic Attack Value of Weapon Possessed"

	This means that a playerâ€™s level and Intelligence attribute, combined with the Magic Attack Value provided by equipped weapons, determine their baseline Magic 
Attack Value.

	Sources of Magic Attack Value

1. "Weapons" : The primary source of MAV is weapons. Many magical and mystical weapon types have specific Magic Attack Value attributes, making them essential for 
classes that rely on spells.
2. "Potions" : Certain potions provide temporary boosts to Magic Attack Value, allowing for increased spell potency in critical situations.
3. "Runes" : Some certaain runes, may increase temporary "MAV".
	Additional Notes
4. "Inner Core System" : Inner Core System increase Magic Attack Value depending of the clarity and level of the piece.

- "Non-Applicability" : Magic Attack Value does not affect healing or health restoration through bandages or healing potions, as it is limited solely to spells.
  
	By carefully selecting gear and occasionally utilizing potions, players can maximize their Magic Attack Value, enhancing both their offensive and healing 
capabilities in the "World Game".
