			Magic Defense

	The value of magic defense without additional bonuses is given by the formula:

"Level + Intelligence + Vitality/3 + (Defense - Vitality - Level)/2"

	Magic spells from the following five schools can be resisted with magic resistance: "Fire", "Ice**, "Earth", "Wind", and "Shadow". There is no resistance stat 
for "Holy" spells, and as such, neither players nor NPCs can resist Holy spells.

	Sources of Magic Defense:
1. "Armor" : Higher-level armors, especially "Rare" and "Legendary" items, come with built-in Magic Defense bonuses.
   
2. "Potions" : Certain potions provide temporary boosts to Magic Defense, helping to resist magical damage.
   
3. "Food" : Cooked food can increase Magic Defense when consumed, though some drinks may not stack with food offering the same bonuses.

4. "Helmets & Bracelets" : Specific helmets and bracelets can be enchanted with Magic Defense bonuses to provide additional protection from magic attacks.

5. "Inner Core Syste" : The "Inner Core System" can be used to increase a character's Magic Defense. This system offers a unique way to enhance magical resistance through internal energy channels, providing a substantial increase in defense against magic-based attacks.
