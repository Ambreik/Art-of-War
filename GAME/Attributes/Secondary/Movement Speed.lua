			Movement Speed

	Movement Speed determines how quickly a player, NPC, monster, pet, or mount can move from one point to another. Each character begins with a default Movement 
Speed of 100%, which can be adjusted based on various factors such as equipment, skills, and external effects.

		Movement Speed Decreases

	Movement speed can also be reduced by various items and effects:

- Items that Decrease Movement Speed :
   - Armor : Some armor may have a penalty to movement speed.
   -  Shields : Similar to armor, certain shields can decrease movement speed.
   -  Carrying Items : The more items a character carries in their inventory, the more their movement speed is affected. This effect is not applied when traveling with a "Sprint Mount."

- Debuffs : Various debuffs can also affect movement speed, such as:
   - "Slowdown" (or other similar status effects) can reduce movement speed.

	Movement Forms

- "Running" : Running continuously drains the character's "Stamina". Once the Stamina reaches 0, the character automatically begins walking until Stamina is refilled.
  
- "Walking" : Walking does not drain Stamina, and it allows the Stamina to regenerate slowly. Standing idle causes Stamina to regenerate very quickly.

- "Flying" : Flying allows movement in the air, usually at a faster rate than walking or running. Certain mounts or abilities allow a character to fly. Flying does 
not drain Stamina like running but may be subject to limits based on specific game mechanics or conditions.

- "Swimming" : Swimming enables movement in water. Swimming speed is generally slower than running, and some abilities or items may increase swimming speed. 
Swimming can also be affected by water depth or the player's equipment.

	Movement Speed Cap

- "Maximum Movement Speed" : The maximum movement speed is capped at 200%. Any value higher than 200% is interpreted as 200%, except for "Sprint Mounts", which can 
unlock movement speeds up to 250% while riding.
