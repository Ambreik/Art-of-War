			Cooldown Reduction

	"Cooldown Reduction" (CDR) is a secondary attribute that influences how quickly abilities and spells become usable again after being activated. It applies to 
all character classes, affecting both magical and non-magical abilities. Understanding and optimizing CDR allows players to use abilities more frequently, enhancing
strategic options in both PvE and PvP encounters.

		Basics of Cooldown Reduction

	Each character starts with a "Spell/Charm Speed" value of 100%, which can be improved through CDR bonuses from various sources:

- "Necklaces" (Standard Bonus)
- "Weapons"
- "Armor"
- "Stone of Cooldown" (socketable in weapons)
- "Haste Buffs" : Provided by certain classes, such as the healing shaman, which boosts CDR temporarily.
- "Runes" : For example, the "Liquor of Haste" rune increases CDR by 20% for 30 minutes.

	Types of Cooldown

1. "Ability Cooldown" :
   - Definition : The time required after using a spell, skill, or item before it becomes available again.
   - Usage : High-impact abilities often have longer cooldowns, encouraging players to choose carefully when to use them.
   - Exceptions : Some abilities have no cooldown, allowing frequent or continuous usage as long as other requirements (such as mana or resources) are met.

2. "Global Cooldown" (GCD) :
   - Definition : The universal cooldown that activates each time an ability or spell is used, briefly locking out other abilities.
   - Purpose : Prevents the simultaneous use of multiple abilities, requiring a sequential approach.
   - Details :
     - Most abilities trigger the GCD.
     - Abilities with a casting time shorter than the GCD or instant casts may require waiting until the GCD finishes.
     - Interrupting a spell cancels the GCD, allowing immediate use of another spell.

3. "Shared Cooldown" :
   - Definition : When using one ability or item puts others with a shared cooldown on hold.
   - Implication : Choosing one spell or item over another can limit access to similar abilities for the duration of the shared cooldown, often requiring strategic decisions in combat.
   - Examples : Potions often share cooldowns with each other, limiting rapid successive use.

4. "Tradeskill Cooldowns" :
   - Enchanting : Enchantments can be attempted every 60 seconds, even if the enchantment fails.
   - Biology Missions : Early missions have a 24-hour cooldown, with legendary missions taking up to 72 hours.

	Additional Mechanics and Notes

- Pushback from Damage : Pushback can increase cooldown times when taking damage while casting, as with cast-time spells.
- Mana Consumption : Mana is only spent upon successful activation for most spells; for instant and channeled abilities, mana is consumed immediately.
- Powerful Abilities : High-impact abilities with lengthy cooldowns are often saved for boss fights or critical PvP encounters, balancing power with accessibility.
