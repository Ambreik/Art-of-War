			Attack Speed

	Attack Speed Overview :
- "Attack Speed" defines how quickly a character can perform hits, determining the frequency of attacks in combat. 
- All characters start with a "default attack speed" of 80%, but the "maximum cap" is 200% (comprising 100% standard attack speed + 100% from bonuses, skills, or other enhancements).

	Class and Weapon Influence :
- Each weapon type has a unique "base attack speed", meaning that even at the same attack speed percentage, a dagger (e.g., "Ninja" class) will strike faster than a "Warrior" with a sword. Larger or slower weapons like two-handed swords or bows will attack more slowly.
- **Class Impact : Speed-oriented classes (e.g., "Assassins" and "Rogues" or "Warrior DPS" classes) generally have higher attack speeds than caster classes like 
"Shamans" or "Sorcerers".

	Effects of Attack Speed :
- Higher Attack Speed : More frequent attacks, increasing damage output over time.
- Low Attack Speed : Lower attack frequency, with a potential risk of attacks missing. Characters with high attack speeds enjoy a better chance to hit consistently.

	Ways to Improve Attack Speed :

1. "Potions" : Certain potions provide temporary boosts to attack speed.
   - Example Potions:

2. Food : Consuming special food can provide minor boosts.
   - Example Foods:

3. Items : Specific weapons, armor, or accessories can grant permanent or temporary bonuses.
   - Example Items:
 
4. Runes : Runes can be equipped to temporarily or permanently enhance attack speed.
   - Example Runes:
 
5. Skills : Some skills in certain classes increase attack speed for a short duration.
   - Example Skills:
 
6. Guild Skill (Only Active in Guild Wars):
   - Guild skills provide attack speed boosts exclusive to Guild Wars, encouraging collaborative strategy.

7. Bonus Buffs :
   - Some environments or events in-game offer buffs to increase **attack speed by a specific percentage**.

8. Inner Core System :
   - The "Inner Core System" can grant attack speed bonuses as characters advance through its levels.
