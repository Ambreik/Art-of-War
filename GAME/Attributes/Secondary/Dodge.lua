			Dodge

	"Dodge" is a key defensive attribute in" World Game" that enables players to avoid melee attacks entirely, providing a crucial advantage, especially for tanking 
roles. Dodge relies primarily on a playerâ€™s Dexterity (DEX) and can be further enhanced by certain mounts, items, and potions.

		Calculating Dodge

	Dodge is influenced directly by Dexterity, with an increasing rate of Dodge as Dexterity is raised. This scaling is not linear; instead, the higher the Dexterity,
the more rapidly Dodge points accumulate. The general relationship is:
- 90 DEX = 30 Dodge points

	Additionally, mounting a horse can boost Dexterity if it falls below a set threshold, thereby raising Dodge temporarily. A "Legendary horse" provides an 
additional 68 Dexterity, contributing to a substantial Dodge boost for players with lower base Dexterity.

	Dodge Mechanics and Effects

1. "Avoiding Melee Attacks" : Dodge completely mitigates a melee attack, making it essential for avoiding damage in close-range combat. However, Dodge only applies to
melee swings:
   - "Cannot dodge" ranged attacks or spells.
   - "Facing Requirement" : Players must face their opponent to dodge an attack, although enemies can dodge attacks from behind.
   - "Incapacitation Limitation" : Stunned or incapacitated players lose their ability to dodge until they recover.

2. "Factors Affecting Dodge" :
   - "Opponent Level" : Dodge effectiveness can vary based on the level difference between the player and the attacker.
   - "Class and Specialization" : Certain classes and talent specializations have a naturally higher Dodge chance.
   - "Equipment and Buffs" : Items and consumables can boost Dodge, increasing both Dodge rating and percentage.

	Items and Consumables Enhancing Dodge

- Items :
  - Wooden Earrings : These provide Dexterity as a base bonus, which increases Dodge indirectly.

- Potions :
  - Potion of Great Escape : Grants additional Dodge benefits:
    - Ninja Race : +10 Dexterity
    - Other Classes : +5 Evasion (a related evasion stat)
