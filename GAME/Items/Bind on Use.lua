			Bind on Use (BoU)

	"Bind on Use" (BoU) refers to items that become soulbound when they are first used. These items are not bound until they are actually activated by the player. 
This property applies to items that can be used directly from the player's inventory, without needing to be equipped. 

		BoU Activation :
	When a BoU item is used for the first time, a warning will appear asking the player if they are sure they want to bind the item. Once used, the item becomes 
"soulbound" to the player, and it "cannot be traded" or sold.

		Historical Context :
	In the early history of the game, most "mounts" and "companions" were Bind on Use items. These items became soulbound when activated or summoned. However, in more
recent updates, many of these items have been converted into consumables that grant permanent benefits, such as recipes or abilities, which are now stored in the Collections window.

	Though these consumables no longer remain as "soulbound items" in the inventory, they still grant permanent abilities to the player, making them functionally 
similar to BoU items. These consumables cannot be traded because the abilities they grant are account-bound, but they no longer take up inventory space as a soulbound
item once used.
