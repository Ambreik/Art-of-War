			Bind on Equip (BoE)

	An item is "Bind on Equip" (BoE) if it becomes soulbound to the character once it is equipped. Before a player equips a BoE item for the first time, a warning 
will appear asking if the player is sure they want to do so.

	In other words, once the item is equipped, it "cannot" be traded, placed on the Auction House, or given to another player. The item is permanently bound to the 
character who equips it.

	Some "BoE" items, especially rare or epic ones that drop from enemies or bosses, can be sold for significant amounts of gold. In group-based activities, such 
items are typically rolled on by players based on loot rules that were agreed upon beforehand.

Note: The in-game tooltip will display the phrase "Binds when equipped",and while some players may refer to it as "BwE", the term "BoE" is generally more widely used.
