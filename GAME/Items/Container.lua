		Types of Containers

1. "Bags" :
   - Bags are equippable items that players can use to store other items. They can be equipped to increase inventory space, allowing players to carry more items 
at will.
  
2. Lootable Objects :
   - These objects appear in the world and can be looted by players. Once they are emptied, they disappear. Common lootable objects include:
     - "Chests" : Found around the world and looted. Some may require keys to unlock, and they come in different forms, like footlockers, baskets, etc.
     - "Ore Veins" and "Herb Objects" : These containers require certain **gathering skills** (such as Mining or Herbalism) to access. They provide materials that can be collected and used for crafting or other purposes.

3. Lootable Items :
   - "Lootable Items" are items that players acquire through different means, often tied to specific activities or quests:
     - Lockboxes : These are items acquired as loot and are always locked. Players need keys to open them.
     - Junkboxes : Acquired by "pickpocketing", these are also "locked items" that contain various loot.
     - Reward Bags : Special bags awarded as part of quest rewards or events.
     - *Quest Containers : Some quests may require players to collect or interact with containers, especially when dealing with multiple quest items.

4. Notional Containers :
   - These are items that are considered containers in the real world but do not have distinct, separately represented contents within the game.Some examples include:
     - Water Bucket : When looted, it appears in the playerâ€™s inventory and holds water, but once used, it disappears without showing its contents.
     - Letters : Some letters can be read, while others serve as quest-related items with no separate representation for their contents.
     - Quest Containers : These are often special items related to specific quests. They cannot be opened or interacted with outside of their quest context.
