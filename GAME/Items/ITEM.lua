			ITEM

	Definition : An item in "World Game" refers to an object that a player character can carry within their inventory. Items are represented by icons in the 
inventory or character sheet, and they can serve various purposes in gameplay. While items are conceptually stored in the player's inventory, some items may also 
have a physical manifestation in the game world. For example, when a character equips clothing gear, the corresponding gear appears on the character model in the 
game world.

	Types of Items	  
	1. "Equippable Items"  
   Equippable items are those that can be worn, wielded, or used by the player character to enhance their stats or abilities. These items are typically displayed on
  the character model in the game world when equipped.
- "Clothing/Armor" : Items such as armor and clothing gear can be equipped by characters. Once equipped, these items are displayed on the character's avatar.
- "Weapons" : Weapons are items that are equipped for combat. When equipped, they appear on the character's hands or body.
- "Helmet" : Headgear that provides defense or special bonuses.
- "Shield" : A defensive item used to block attacks, often providing protection in combat.
- "Arrows" : Ammunition for ranged weapons, such as bows or crossbows.
- "Totem" : A mystical item that may provide buffs or enhance certain abilities or stats.
- "Rune" : Magical items that can be inscribed onto weapons, armor, or accessories to grant additional powers.
- "Necklace" : A piece of jewelry that can provide a variety of buffs or enhancements to the wearer.
- "Rings" : Jewelry worn on the fingers, often providing additional stats or magical effects.
- "Earrings" : Jewelry worn on the ears that grants various benefits, such as elemental resistance or health boosts.
- "Shoes" : Footwear that enhances movement speed or provides protection from certain environmental hazards.
- "Belt" : A waist item that can offer stat boosts or extra inventory space.
- "Sash" : A decorative yet functional piece of clothing that provides additional benefits, such as agility or mana regeneration.
- "Costume" : A costume is a cosmetic item that goes over armor or weapons as a "skin" to change their appearance. Costumes do not provide additional stats or buffs but serve to personalize the character’s look. They are often used for visual customization and can be equipped on top of armor or weapons to alter their appearance without affecting their functionality.

	2. "Consumable Items"  
- Healing Potions : Items that restore health or provide buffs when used. These items are consumed upon use.
- Buff Items : Items that temporarily boost a character's stats or abilities.

	3. "Summon Items"  
- Some items teach the character how to summon creatures, companions, or mounts. These items no longer spawn creatures directly but instead provide the character with the ability to summon them when needed. The companion or mount summoned will have its own inventory, freeing up the player’s inventory space.

	4. "Containers"  
- Container Items : These items can store other items within them. For example, bags or chests serve as container items, allowing players to manage their inventory more efficiently.  
- Conceptual Items : Some items represent intangible game mechanics, such as quest items or special tokens, which do not have a direct object in the game world.

	5. "Passive Ability Items"  
- Some items grant passive abilities that affect the character without needing to be actively used. These items only need to be carried by the player character to provide their benefits.

	Acquisition of Items  
- Purchasing : Players can buy items from vendors using in-game currency.  
- Looting : Items can be looted from various sources, such as defeated enemies, treasure chests, and certain environmental objects.
- Quest Rewards : Players often receive items as rewards for completing quests.
- Auction House and Mail : Items may be traded, sold, or bought from other players via the auction house or by sending them through in-game mail. Depending on the item's binding, it may or may not be tradable.

	Interacting with Items  
- Players interact with items by "right-clicking" on the item icon in their inventory or other venues. The right-click action may result in different outcomes based on the context:
  - Equip : Right-clicking will equip the item, if applicable (e.g., armor, weapons).
  - Use : Consumables like potions or scrolls can be used by right-clicking.
  - Sell : If interacting with a vendor, right-clicking an item may sell it to the vendor (if the player isn’t careful).
  - Teach : Some items, such as summonable mounts or companions, teach the player a new ability instead of being consumed or used directly.
  - Open : some items, such containers require a confirmation before are opened and the item or items that are inside, are dropped into the inventory.

		Item Categories	  
	Items are categorized primarily based on their quality and usefulness. The rarity and power of an item may determine its availability, how difficult it is to 
acquire, and its potential in the game. Categories may include:
- "Common Items" : Basic items that are easily accessible.
- "Uncommon Items" : Items with moderate power and some uniqueness.
- "Rare Items" : Items that are more difficult to obtain and have powerful effects or high value.
- "Epic Items" : Items that are of exceptional power or rarity, often requiring difficult challenges to obtain.
- "Legendary Items" : Rare and powerful items with special abilities or lore, usually obtainable only through major achievements or significant quests.
- "Special Items" : These items are categorized as equipment but have unique properties or functionalities. They may have specific lore, abilities, or effects that set them apart from standard equipment, often tied to specific quests or events.

	Item Binding  
- "Bound Items" : Certain items become bound to the player when acquired, meaning they cannot be traded, sold, or mailed to other players.
- "Unbound Items" : Items that are not bound can be freely traded, sold, or shared between players.
