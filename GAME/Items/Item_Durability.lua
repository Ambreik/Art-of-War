			Item Durability

		Durability  

	"Durability" is a property of equippable items that determines how much damage they can take before being broken. Broken items can always be repaired; gear 
never breaks permanently. Durability damage is not the same as normal damage but can be dealt in certain circumstances:  

- In PvP stance :  
  - By "Pindars" using their PvP bonus on weapons ("Dark HIT").  
  - By "Knights" using their PvP bonus on weapons ("Holy HIT").  

- In PvM stance :  
  - By all monsters with Rank 3+.  

	Only "armor", "weapons", and "shields" (for classes that can wield shields) have this durability mechanic. "Legendary weapons, armor, shields, or special weapons" are not affected by durability loss.

	Repairing Items  

- Any NPC who sells armor (or blacksmithing supplies) can repair durability. These NPCs are found in different maps than Map1 for each faction.  
- Repair options include:  
  1. "Repair all items" (button resembling an anvil with a gold +).  
  2. "Repair a single item" (button resembling a hammer).  
  3. "Guild repairs" (requires guild access and funds).  

- The "Repair all items" button also repairs items in your inventory.

		Repair Cost  

	The base cost to repair depends on the item's quality and level. Assuming neutral reputation with the vendor:  

1. Uncommon armor piece :  
   \[
   \text{Repair cost} = \text{Durability points to repair} \times (\text{ilevel} - 32.5) \times 0.02 \, \text{silver}
   \]  

2. Rare armor piece :  
   \[
   \text{Repair cost} = \text{Durability points to repair} \times (\text{ilevel} - 32.5) \times 0.025 \, \text{silver}
   \]  

3. Epic armor piece :  
   \[
   \text{Repair cost} = \text{Durability points to repair} \times (\text{ilevel} - 32.5) \times 0.05 \, \text{silver}
   \]  

- Reputation discounts:  
  - Friendly: 5%  
  - Noble: 25%  
  - Worship: 50%

	Item Instant Repair  

	Some items can instantly repair or regenerate durability:  

- "Clock of Time" : Crafted or obtained from a quest at level 33.  
- "Greasy Drop" : Restores 10% of missing durability to an item.  
- "Burning Iron Orb" : Repairs a broken item or regenerates its durability.  
- "Hammer of Lord" : Repairs a broken item or regenerates its durability.

		Durability Loss  

	Durability is reduced in the following scenarios:  

- "Comba"t : Gradual durability loss on all equipped items during combat, regardless of damage dealt or taken.  
- "Armor Hits" : Small chance to lose 1 durability point with each hit absorbed.  
- "Death" : 10% durability loss on all equipped items (based on max durability). Exclusions:  
	- PvP deaths.  
	- Deaths from suicide using items or spells.  
	- Environmental deaths (e.g., falling) still cause durability loss.

	Low Durability Alerts  

- Below 25% : A yellow icon appears in the top-left of the screen, corresponding to the item.  
- At 0% : A red icon appears. Items at 0% durability can still be equipped but lose all stat benefits (e.g., resistances, armor, set bonuses).  

	Items cannot permanently break!  

---

		Maximum Durability  

	Maximum durability is determined by the item's "type", "level", and "quality".  

- Items below level 20 : No durability mechanic.
