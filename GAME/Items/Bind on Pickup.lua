			Bind on Pickup (BoP)

	Bind on Pickup (BoP) , also known as "Bind on Acquire", is an item property where the item becomes soulbound when it is:

- Looted from a corpse or container
- Given as a quest reward from an NPC
- Purchased from a vendor
- Crafted by a player
- Received through in-game mail

	Once an item is picked up (or acquired in any of the above ways), it **immediately becomes bound to the character** who acquired it. It is not possible to have a BoP item in your inventory without it being bound to you.

	Common Sources for BoP Items :
- Most loot from bosses and rewards from quests are "BoP".
- Vendor-purchased PvP rewards and most reputation-based rewards are also "BoP".
- A warning appears before a player loots a BoP item, asking if they are sure they want to do so. This applies to both looting and rolling on BoP items (using Need or Greed in Group Loot).
  
However, "BoP items" acquired while in a group "can be traded to other group members" if certain conditions are met, but this is usually only available for a limited time. In the case of Indoor drops, BoP items may be traded for up to "two hours after they are dropped". Once the item is enchanted, socketed, or otherwise altered, it will become immediately untradeable.

		Crafted BoP Items :
	Crafted items that are "BoP" can only be acquired by the player who crafted them. Although, in some cases, players may drop their crafting profession after making
any BoP items they wish to keep, though some items may require a certain skill level or specialization to equip.

		Tooltip Information :
	The in-game tooltip displays "Binds when picked up", which leads some players to use the term "BwP". However, "BoP" is more commonly used. While "Bind on Acquire"
is sometimes used by players, it is not an in-game term and can be confusing, as it can be mistaken for the "Bind to Account" property of items.

		Removing BoP Property :
	To remove the BoP property from an item, a special item, such as [Mechanical Fix] or [Garlig Touch], must be used. Each of these items has a "50% chance of success", and players can attempt to remove the BoP property up to three times per item. However, some players believe the actual chance of success is lower due to the extreme difficulty of removing the BoP property.
