			Bind to Account (BoA or BtA)

	Bind to Account" (BoA), also sometimes referred to as "Bind to Account" (BtA), is a form of item binding that applies to items purchased from the Item-Shop or 
obtained through special promotions. These items are bound to the account that purchases or acquires them and cannot be traded or sold to other players in the game.

		Key Features of BoA Items :

1. Account-Specific Binding :
   Items that are "BoA" can only be used by the player on the account that originally purchased or acquired them. These items are account-bound, meaning they cannot 
be transferred to other players even through trade or the auction house.

2. Mailing Restrictions :
   While BoA items cannot be traded directly, some BoA items can be mailed to other characters on the same account. However, this feature comes with a restriction: 
players are only allowed to mail up to three BoA items per week to other characters on the same account. This limit ensures that the item stays within the player's 
account but can be shared across multiple characters.

3. Common Uses :
   These items are often cosmetics, account-bound boosts, or exclusive in-game content purchased from the Item-Shop. They are not intended to be part of the game's 
trading economy, serving instead as rewards or enhancements for the playerâ€™s account.
