			Boat

	Boats, also known as ships or sea vessels, are an essential form of transportation primarily used between "Knights" harbors but also found at neutral harbors. 
The "Pindars" later develop their own style of boats designed to be more convenient for transporting prey, food, or other supplies. Boats are docked for exactly 60 
seconds before they depart.

	Types of Boats

1. "Ghost Ship Travel"
- Description: Ghost Ships always have crew NPC members aboard that players can interact with. Some of these NPCs serve as quest-givers or vendors, while all are 
"Skillable."
   
2. "Merchant Ship"
- Description: Merchant Ships (or trading vessels) are used to transport general goods across the "World Game" and can often be found docked at major ports.
   
3. "Rowboat"
- Description: Rowboats are small, 8- to 12-foot-long boats, typically for 2 to 3 people, and are primarily used for fishing. They are more durable than small boats.
   
4. "Fishing Boat"
- Description: Fishing Boats are typically found near lakes where a "Fisherman Master" NPC is present. These boats can be rented for a specific time until their 
durability reaches zero and they sink. They come in two sizes:
	- Small: One-person capacity.
	- Large: Up to 4 people. Durability lasts up to 5 hours.
   
5. "Transport Ship"
- Description: Transport Ships come in various designs depending on the race but serve the same purpose: carrying troops and equipment across bodies of water to 
remote battle locations. There are two such ships docked in "Dendera Port."
   
6. "Warship"
- Description: Warships are large, 100-foot-long ships with a single mast and oars to propel them. They typically carry 60 to 80 rowers and can transport up to 160 
soldiers, though they are not designed for long-distance travel due to limited supplies. These ships are usually confined to coastal routes and move at around 2 Â½ 
miles per hour when rowed or under sail. The largest warship is still docked in "Capital City Port."
