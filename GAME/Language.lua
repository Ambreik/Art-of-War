			Language

		Language System Overview

	In "World Game", languages play a crucial role in player progression, faction dynamics, and quest completion. Each race and faction primarily 
speaks their own unique language, but "Common" serves as a universal language understood by most intelligent races. The ability to learn additional 
languages becomes accessible at level 30, once players reach "Middlean Islands".

	Learning New Languages
- Level Requirement : Players can start learning new languages after reaching level 30 when they gain access to the "Middlean Islands".
- Mechanism : Languages are learned passively by reading specific books related to each language. Players must read 20 unique books to master a 
language. Books can be obtained through drops, vendors, or other sources.
- Language Sheets : Each language has a corresponding sheet in the "Skill and Abilities" window under the "Passive Abilities" section.

	Impact on Gameplay
- Questlines and Interactions : Mastery of languages is crucial to unlocking quests and interacting with NPCs from different regions. Upon arrival at 
new continents or cities, players may only understand NPCs related to the main questline unless they have learned the local language.
  - For example, in "Zanken Shore" and "Ancient City of Sankis", players must learn the "Danbon language" to interact fully with the NPCs for quests 
and mechanics.
  - In "Legrand", players must learn the "Ancient Unknown Language" to interact with NPCs, complete quests, and access certain mechanics.

	Summary of Language Features
- Passive Ability : Players automatically speak their faction's language and must learn others through reading books.
- Progression : After reaching level 30, players unlock the ability to learn other languages, enabling them to interact with NPCs from different 
regions.
- Language Mastery : Requires reading 20 specific books per language to fully understand it.
- Quest and NPC Interaction : Knowledge of additional languages is essential for progressing in certain quests and completing objectives in foreign 
regions. end 

		Key Points of the Language Mechanic**

1. Race and Faction-Specific Languages :
   - Factions and Races have specific native languages (e.g., "Zhinka" for Pindars, "Bastilla" for Vampires, "Wolfish" for Werewolves,etc.) that are 
automatically known to the player once they create a character of that race/faction. 
   - "Common" serves as the universal language understood by most factions, allowing basic communication between players and NPCs across different 
races.

2. Learning New Languages :
   - As players progress to level 30, they unlock the ability to learn new languages upon reaching the "Middlean Islands". These languages are 
necessary for progressing in quests, completing interactions with NPCs in new regions, and solving location-specific puzzles.
   - Learning a Language : Players can acquire new languages by reading specific books. To master a language, players need to read 20 different books
related to that language. The more books players read, the greater their understanding of that language, allowing them to interact with NPCs from 
different regions.
   - These books can be dropped, purchased from vendors, or found through quest rewards.

3. Language and Quest Progression :
   - Initial Communication : Upon arriving in regions like "Zanken Shore" or "Legrand" players will only understand NPCs involved in the main 
questline. To fully interact with the locals and complete side quests or important story objectives, they must learn the regional language.
     - For "Zanken Shore", players need to learn "Danbon" to understand and progress with quests.
     - For "Legrand", players must learn the "Ancient Unknown Language" to interact with NPCs and advance through key storylines.
   - Without the proper language knowledge, players will be limited to interactions with NPCs related to the main storyline and will miss out on vital
side content or mechanics.

4. Language as a Passive Ability :
   - The language mechanic is treated as a "passive ability". Once a language is learned, it is permanently unlocked and integrated into the player’s 
ability to understand and interact with NPCs.
   - This is tracked in the "Skill and Abilities" window under the "Passive Abilities" section, where players can see their progress in learning each 
language.

5. Interaction with NPCs :
   - Different factions may have languages that other factions don’t fully understand, making interactions with certain NPCs more challenging unless 
the player has learned their language.
   - This mechanic encourages exploration and lore discovery as players seek out books, vendors, or questlines that teach them new languages, 
unlocking further content in the game.

	Example of Language Use in Gameplay

1. The Aarong Faction :
   - "Danbon" is the primary language spoken by the "Aarong Forest" faction. Players from other factions who enter "Aarong territory" will need to 
learn "Danbon" to fully understand quest givers, side missions, and critical narrative events tied to the Aarong.

2. Legrand :
   - "Ancient Unknown Language" : Players arriving in "Legrand" will only be able to understand main quest-related NPCs unless they learn the 
"Ancient Unknown Language" by reading 20 different books related to it. This language is crucial for understanding hidden lore, quests, and NPC 
dialogue.

3. Zanken Shore :
   - "Danbon" : Similar to the "Aarong Faction", players in "Zanken Shore" will encounter Danbon-speaking NPCs. If they haven't learned this language 
yet, they will be restricted in how they can interact with the locals and will miss certain quests and interactions.
