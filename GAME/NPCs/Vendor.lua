			Vendor

---

	1. Introduction  
	A "Vendor" is an NPC that buys and sells items to players. While similar to trainers in that they provide goods, vendors also accept items in exchange for gold 
or currency. The term "vendor trash" refers to items that have no use other than to be sold to vendors. "Vendors" are essential for players to acquire basic items, 
consumables, armor, weapons, accessories, and unique goods, depending on the type of vendor and their location.

	2. Types of Vendors  
Vendors are divided into the following categories, each specializing in different types of goods:

- "Regional Merchants"  
- "Armor Vendor"  
- "Weapon Vendor"  
- "Accessory Vendor"  
- "Class Teachers"  
- "Profession Teachers"  
- "General Vendors"  
- "Other Vendors"

	3. Mechanics and Features

- "Vendor Icons" : Each vendor class has its own cursor icon indicating whether they are available or out of range.
- "Buyback" : Players can buy back items they sold to a vendor by accessing the "Buyback tab". A player can repurchase up to 10 items sold since their last login. 
This list is cleared when they leave the current zone.
- "Reputation (REP)" : Many vendors, especially those located outside settlements, have "REP" with which players can unlock discounts or new items. "REP" can be 
increased through quests, trading, and interactions.
- "Bulk Purchases" : Some vendors sell goods in bulk, such as ammunition, but typically exclude armor and weapons. For example, arrows are sold in packs of 100 or 
200.
- "Skillability and PvP" : Outdoor vendors are skillable NPCs that can turn Unfriendly or disappear if attacked. PvP actions with vendors block trades, prevent gaining REP, and prevent receiving quests or help from them.
- "Shop Windows" : All vendors have shop windows with slots for their goods. The number of items available in the window increases based on the player's **REP** or "level".
- "Vendor Shop Background" : The shop window has a background image representing the goods for sale.
