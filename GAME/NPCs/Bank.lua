			Bank

	A "Bank" is a building or storage system that provides players with access to private vaults for storing items not currently in use. Players can access their 
bank storage from any branch of a bank across major cities and towns, with the option to store and withdraw items at their convenience.

	Locations : 
- Banks are typically located in major cities and towns.
- The physical structure is referred to as the "Bank" or "Vault", and it is managed by a "Store Manager" NPC.

	Functions and Mechanics : 
1. "Bank Vaults" : 
   - Banks provide a secure location where players can store items they donâ€™t need immediately.
   - Players can access the same vault from any bank branch, meaning items stored in one branch can be accessed in another.
   - Faction Restriction :  Players cannot use the bank of opposing factions, as they cannot interact with the "Store Manager" NPC of the opposing faction.

2. "Bank Space" (Vault Slots) : 
   - The initial vault storage offers 50 slots at no cost to the player.
   - Additional space can be unlocked by purchasing extra pages. The cost starts low and increases with each page added.
   - The cost for additional slots:
		- The first additional pages cost starting at 10s per 5 slots, and increase incrementally (20s, 30s, 40s, etc.).
		- As the bank expands, the cost of each additional slot line grows progressively.
   - Unlimited Storage :  Players can unlock unlimited slots using one of two methods:
     1. "Letter of Good Faith" : A rare item obtained from a difficult quest. This unlocks permanent storage expansion.
     2. "Inscription of a Store Manager" : Temporarily unlocks unlimited storage for 30 days. After the period expires, the storage reverts to normal.

3. Inventory Scroll : 
   - Once the bank has been unlocked to a higher storage capacity (via the Letter of Good Faith or Inscription of a Store Manager), a **scroll wheel** becomes available on the right side of the bank interface to allow easy navigation of the expanded storage.

4. Shared Vault : 
	- All characters created on the same account, share the same "Bank".

		Portable Banks

	"Portable Banks" are items that allow players to access their bank storage while in the wilderness or while adventuring, reducing the need to travel back to a 
physical bank branch. However, due to their long cooldowns (typically an hour or more), they are not meant to completely replace the need for traveling to a bank.

		Known Portable Banks :

2. "Artisan Bart" (Pindar NPC):

	Usage : 
- These "Portable Banks" are activated using a spawn item and can be summoned by players to access their vaults temporarily without having to visit a physical bank.
- After the designated time expires or the player leaves the area, the "Store Manager" disappears, and the portable bank becomes inactive.
