			Auctioneer

	An "Auctioneer" is a specialized NPC who facilitates player-to-player transactions by allowing characters to create, list, and bid on auctions within the game. 
Auctioneers provide a marketplace where players can trade goods, with the NPC serving as the intermediary for managing bids and transactions.

	Locations : 
- Found in major cities and "Bazzar" across the game world.
- Auctioneers are typically located in dedicated buildings, which are often well-guarded by "Guardians".

	Appearance : 
- Auctioneers are typically well-dressed, reflecting their role as prominent figures in the marketplace.
- They are often surrounded by a stack of gold coins, marking their presence for easy identification, especially on the minimap when using the tracking system.

	Functions : 

1. "Auction System" : 
   - Auctioneers allow players to create auctions by listing their items for sale to the general public.
   - Players can bid on items posted by others, creating a dynamic trading environment.
   - The auction system provides a virtual marketplace where players can buy, sell, and trade items without direct interaction.
   - Auctioneers handle all bidding and transaction logistics, ensuring that successful bids are processed and items are transferred to the winning bidder.

2. "Auction Fees" : 
   - Players are required to pay a fee to use the auction service. This fee is typically paid when the player first lists an item for auction.
   - A small secondary fee is charged to the seller once the item is sold, ensuring the Auctioneer is compensated for their services.
   - The auction interface is automatically displayed upon interacting with the Auctioneer, making the process seamless for players.

3. "Virtual Market and Automatic Messages" : 
   - The Auctioneer generates automatic messages that inform item owners about the status of their auction and provide alerts when their items are bid on or sold.
   - Common auctioneer messages:
     - "Please feel free to browse the items up for bid, or to list an item, I can help with pleasure."
     - "Money means success, we can be full of it together."
   - These messages are part of the system that ensures the auction process is transparent and players are always kept informed.

4. "Auctioneer Interaction" : 
   - When interacting with the Auctioneer, players enter the auction interface, where they can list items, place bids, or browse available auctions.
   - The Auctioneer's presence is marked by a stack of gold coins, visible on the minimap, to indicate the availability of the auction system in the area.

	Guardians and Protection : 
- Auctioneers are well-guarded by Guardians stationed around the Auctioneer's building. This ensures the safety of the marketplace and prevents interference from hostile players or NPCs.
- These Guardians are typically stationed near the entrance or in strategic areas to protect both the Auctioneer and the items being auctioned.

	Skillable NPC : 
- The Auctioneer is skillable but not a vendor. Players can interact with them to facilitate their auction activities, but they do not engage in trade beyond the auction system.
