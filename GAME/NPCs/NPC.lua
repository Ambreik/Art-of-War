			Non-Playable Character (NPC)

	Introduction :  
	An "NPC (Non-Player Character)" is any character within the "World Game" that is not controlled by human players. These characters are generated and controlled 
by the game server and perform various roles throughout the game world. NPCs can be "Neutral", "Friendly", or aligned with specific factions (e.g., Knight Empire, 
Pindar Empire, Outlaw faction). Players cannot attack NPCs from their own faction unless they are at war with that faction (set via the "Reputation" tab in the 
character sheet). Attacking NPCs of their own faction or neutral NPCs without proper justification results in the player becoming a "Traitor," leading to penalties.

	Typical examples of NPCs include "Quest Givers", "Vendors", "Trainers", "Guards", and "Pedestrians".

	NPC Interactions : 

- Neutral or Friendly NPCs :  
	These NPCs are represented with a "bag icon" (for vendors) or a "talk bubble" (for quest givers). Players must interact with them (such as talking to them) 
before their services become available. The cursor will change depending on the NPC's availability, with specific icons indicating whether the NPC is accessible or 
out of range.

- Hostile NPCs :  
	These NPCs are categorized as monsters or hostile units and may automatically attack players of opposing factions. For example, in certain zones like "Zonen", 
NPCs become hostile to "Knight" players upon entry and attack on sight.

- Traveller Guy :  
	A unique neutral NPC found in every region, acting as a teleporter. It provides fast travel between various locations in the game world.

- Serena : 
	A unique neutral NPC found in every region, in major cities, acting as a teleporter exclusive for "Bazzar".

	NPC Death and Respawn : 

- Skillable NPCs :  
	Many NPCs, especially "Guards" and "Trainers", can be killed by players. Once killed, they respawn randomly between 30 minutes and 3 hours. The players 
responsible for their death receive a debuff based on the specific NPC they killed.
	"Guards" can spawn from 10 seconds up to 10 minutes if are from major cities.
	
- Reputation Loss :  
	Killing NPCs from the same faction as the player decreases their "Reputation" with the respective settlement or region and results in a loss of PvP Ranking 
Grade. Conversely, killing enemy NPCs may increase "Reputation" and "PvP Ranking" within the player's faction.

- No Loot :  
	Killed NPCs drop no gold or items and do not grant "Experience" points. The focus is on "Faction Reputation" and advancing the storyline.

		NPC Behavior and AI Enhancements : 

1. Advanced NPC AI : 
	- NPCs could be programmed with more sophisticated behavior trees that define their interactions and reactions. For example:
		- "Friendly NPCs" could react based on the player’s alignment or Faction Reputation.
		- "Hostile NPCs" could have more dynamic responses, such as calling for reinforcements, running for cover, or changing tactics.
		- NPCs could have emotional states that influence their interactions (e.g., "happy", "angry", "fearful", etc.).
  
2. Dialogue Branching & Dynamic Conversations : 
	- NPCs could have branching dialogue systems that change based on the player's actions, reputation, or past decisions. This can result in NPCs offering 
different quests, rewards, or even alignment shifts.
	- For example, if a player attacks a city’s "Guard", later conversations with the "Guard Captain" might be hostile, or the NPC could give out quests 
specifically targeting the player due to their "reputation" placing them under "Bounty Hunter" posters.

3. NPC Emotions and Morale : 
	- Certain NPCs might have a morale system where their behavior changes depending on the world state or in-game events:
		- A "Tavern Keeper" might be more welcoming if the player has completed a local quest or donated to the establishment.
		- "Guards" might be more aggressive if the player has a negative reputation with their faction.

4. Social NPC Interactions : 
	- NPCs within towns or cities could interact with each other. For example, a "Blacksmith" might argue with a "Craftsman" about a failed crafting recipe or a 
"Guard" might offer advice to a "Traveler".
	- NPCs could also form relationships, such as rivalries or friendships, influencing how they act around each other and the player.

	NPC Special Features and Services : 

1. Loot and Treasure NPCs : 
	- These NPCs may offer loot-based rewards, treasure maps, or participate in random loot drops that appear in the game world. 
	- Some NPCs could also serve as "Raid Leaders" or "Dungeon Masters" who send players into instanced dungeons or world bosses for unique loot.

2. Summonable NPCs : 
   - These could be special NPCs that players can summon as part of a quest or gameplay mechanic. For instance, a "Store Keeper" (or Bank NPC) can be summoned using
a special summining item already discussed.

---

	NPC World Event Interaction : 

- NPCs could react to world events or player-driven changes in the world, such as:
	- "War NPCs" : "NPC Factions" might shift allegiances or offer unique rewards during a world event like a siege or territory war. 
	- "Reputation Impact" : Players’ actions could influence NPC dialogue, trade availability, and quest offerings.
	- "Seasonal Events" : NPCs tied to events like "festivals", "holidays", or in-game "anniversaries" could offer time-limited content and special rewards.

---

	NPC Interactions Based on Player Alignment and Reputation : 

1. Faction Alignment : 
	- NPCs could change their dialogue and quest availability based on the player's alignment or reputation with different factions, guilds, or races. For example:
		- "Outlaws" might receive different quests or rewards from NPCs based on their criminal activities, while "Knights" may receive assistance or training from 
	Paladin NPCs.
  
2. Reputation-Based Services : 
   - As the player’s reputation grows, certain NPCs might unlock additional services, discounts, or exclusive access to higher-tier items or quests.

---

	Additional NPC-Related Systems to Consider : 

- NPC Factions : NPCs can be grouped into factions, and their relationships could dynamically change based on the player’s actions. For example, a "Knight Guard" 
faction may become hostile to a player who aids the "Outlaws".
- Dynamic NPC Schedules : NPCs may operate on dynamic schedules, meaning they are only available at certain times of the day or during certain weather conditions. 

This could create new types of interactions and quests based on time and environment.
