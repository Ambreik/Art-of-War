			LORE / STORYTELLER

		1. Overview

	Lore or Storyteller NPCs are dedicated characters whose main role is to provide players with insight into the history, myths, or background of the world.
	They exist to enhance immersion, deepen the atmosphere of locations, and connect unrelated world elements through dialogue, stories, and ambient conversations.

	They do not provide training, skill progression, or vendor services.
	Their sole function is knowledge-sharing through interactive storytelling.

		2. Primary Function

* Provide world lore , historical accounts , factional myths, character backstories, or localized legends.
* Serve as narrative anchors for new players or those exploring unknown regions.
* Occasionally reference events, creatures, or ancient relics — sometimes can be quest triggers involvulg player into the rich lore of the world game.
* May include a "Listen to Story" or "Ask about [Topic]" dialogue menu for structured storytelling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		3. Behavior and Interaction

* Non-skillable and non-hostile NPCs.
* Cannot be flagged in PvP and do not react to combat around them.
* May occasionally perform idle animations such as:
	* Gesturing with hands when talking.
	* Reading a scroll or holding an old tome.
	* Sitting near a fire, telling tales to ambient NPCs.

* When approached, their interaction options may include:
	* "Tell me a story".
	* "What do you know about this region?"
	* "Do you recall any legends of [creature/item/place]?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		4. Locations

* Commonly found in:
	* "Taverns" (especially near or beside Bards).
	* "Human settlements" and "major cities" close to "Main Questline" NPCs.
	* Occasionally in neutral areas, such as crossroads or resting camps, where they speak to travelers.

* Typically, each "major region" has 1–2 storytellers, each with distinct narrative specialties (e.g., "The Fall of Old Legrand", "The Storm War of Zonen", 
"Whispers of the Tenebress".).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		5. Appearance and Voice

* Usually portrayed as aged scholars, travelers, or local historians.
* Clothing reflects their region’s culture — simple robes, cloaks, or travel-worn gear.
* Carry visual identifiers:
  * A satchel of scrolls.
  * A quill and parchment.
  * Sometimes a small lamp or candle beside them if found in darker interiors.

* Voice tone : calm, wise, and narrative-driven, matching their personality (no emotional manipulation or moral tones).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		6. Dialogue and Mechanics

* Dialogues are non-interruptive, meaning players can leave the conversation at any point.
* When telling stories, text appears progressively (scrolling text or paragraph fade-in) for immersion.
* Certain storytellers may reference:
	* Historical battles.
	* Ancient civilizations.
	* Key NPC figures (without revealing direct questline details).

* Some storytellers may share the same event or myth from different perspectives, emphasizing cultural differences without moral judgment.

		7. Subtypes

| Subtype                  | Description                                                   | Typical Location                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |

		8. Example Interaction

> Player : “Tell me a story.”
> Storyteller : “Ah, you wish to know of the stones beneath your feet? These lands once echoed with the steps of giants… not the kind you find now, but the ones who carried mountains on their backs.”
> (Story fades in, revealing a short lore snippet about the region’s ancient past.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		9. Development Notes

* These NPCs act as passive world anchors — never triggering events, rewards, or combat.
* They serve as lore nodes that can later be connected to new storylines or world events without rewriting existing dialogue.
* May be used to hint at hidden regions, foreshadow future expansions, or reinforce faction identity.
* Optional sound ambiance (soft lute, crackling fire, crowd murmurs) can enhance their presence.
