			Event Planner

		1. Overview

	The "Event Planner" is a permanent NPC side-class located in major human settlements. Unlike the Public Messenger, this NPC has a broader and more active role: 
they coordinate city-wide festivals and celebrations, provide quests related to organizing events, and offer information about current or upcoming city activities. 
They remain non-combative and cannot be targeted for PvP.

		2. General Description

	"Event Planners" are non-hostile, permanent NPCs who patrol their settlement areas and interact with players. Their purpose includes:

* Informing players about ongoing or upcoming festivals, celebrations, or competitions.
* Assigning quests that involve gathering resources, recruiting performers, or completing tasks contributing to the success of the event.
* Enhancing world immersion by reflecting the local culture and region in their appearance and dialogue.

	Players can freely interact with Event Planners without fear of combat, theft, or faction restrictions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		3. Appearance

	Event Planners are regionally adapted, blending naturally with local settlements:

* "Dendera & Zonen" – Formal attire with heraldic accents, scroll satchels, and crested belts.
* "Fanthe’kar & Wastelands" – Desert or arid-themed robes and scarves, practical for sand and heat.
* "Garland & Askania" – Scholarly or civic attire, inspired by town criers and archivists.
* "Middlean Islands" – Blended urban clothing with light festival accessories.
* "Outland Territories" – Frontier-appropriate tunics, rough cloaks, and light armor accents reflecting the region’s elemental traits 
(Aarong Forest – earth, Frozen Territory – ice, Lagooma Jungle – wind/thunder, Tenebress Territory – fire).

	Age and personality vary: some planners are young and energetic, others are mature, wise, and methodical.

		4. Behavior and Movement

* Event Planners wander dynamically through settlements — markets, taverns, city squares, and guild halls.
* They stop periodically to announce events or engage with passing players.
* Patrol paths are radius-limited, ensuring visibility without excessive wandering.
* May perform animations (gestures, bells, scrolls) while making announcements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		5. Dialogue and Announcements

	Event Planners use local chat or voiced text to deliver event-related announcements. Example lines:

* "Citizens of [Settlement Name], prepare! The Festival of Lights approaches, and your talents are required!"
* "Greetings, traveler. Can you assist in gathering supplies for the upcoming Harvest Celebration?"
* "The Council calls upon you to recruit performers for tomorrow’s City Gala!"
* "Step forward, adventurers! A grand competition nears — participate to earn fame and reward!"

When directly interacted with, they may summarize events or provide quest instructions :

> "Welcome, adventurer. Your assistance is needed for today’s festivities. Gather resources, rally performers, or aid in the preparations — the city awaits your help."
