- Permissions :  Permissions for usage (deposit/withdraw) are controlled by guild master and can be customized per guild rank.

	2. Access and Location
- Access Location :   
	- Guild Bank is only accessible within a "Guild Territory".
	- Players can only access it within the boundaries of their guildâ€™s territory or headquarters.

- Guild Master Control :

	3. Storage Details
- Inventory Pages :   
	- The Guild Bank has 3 inventory pages, each with 40 slots.
	- The first page is available for a fee of 100g. Subsequent pages cost 500g and 1000g, respectively.
  
- Money Storage :   
	- The Guild Bank allows for the storage of unlimited money. There is no upper limit for funds stored within the bank.
  
- Item Storage :   
	- Guild members with the appropriate permissions can deposit or withdraw items.
	- Permissions can be set up for different guild ranks, restricting access per page 
	(e.g., some members may only have access to certain pages for depositing/withdrawing).
  
	4. Permission System
- Advanced Permission Control :   
	- The guild master can configure permissions for each page, specifying who can interact with the bank and what actions they can perform 
	(deposit or withdraw items or money).
	- Permissions can be set per page or per guild rank. Specific guild ranks can have different access rights 
	(e.g., higher-ranked members may have broader access).
  
- Withdrawal Limits :   
	- The Guild Master can set withdrawal limits per page or for specific guild ranks.
	- This ensures that no one can withdraw more than the allocated limit unless authorized by the Guild Master.
	- Daily Limit per Member: Each guild member can be restricted to a maximum withdrawal amount per day, in addition to the existing per-page or per-rank limits.
	- Cooldown Between Withdrawals: A minimum cooldown period can be applied between consecutive withdrawals to prevent accidental mass withdrawals, especially in 
large guilds.
  
	5. Repair NPCs Integration
- Repair Functionality :   
	- The Guild Bank is integrated with "Repair NPCs", allowing players to pay for repairs from guild funds (if they have the appropriate permissions).
	- The repair functionality is also bound by the withdrawal limits set by the guild master.
  
	6. Transaction Logs
- Access Logs :   
	- The Guild Bank keeps logs of the latest transactions, including item and money deposits and withdrawals.
	- The logs show the 100 most recent transactions per page, providing transparency for guild members on bank usage.
  
	7. System for Order and Clan
- Unified System :   
	- The Guild Bank system operates the same for both "Order" and "Clan" guilds.  
	- All permissions, storage limits, and access features are consistent regardless of the guild type (Order or Clan).

	8. Additional Notes
- Guild Territory Requirement :   
	- The Guild Bank is accessible only if the guild has an active territory or headquarters that supports this feature.
  
- Customizable Features :   
	- The Guild Master has full customization rights over permissions and features within the Guild Bank system.
