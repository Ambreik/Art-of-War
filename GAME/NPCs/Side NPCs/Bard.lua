			Bard

	The "Bard" is a non-combat NPC found exclusively in taverns across the world. Known for their storytelling, music, and deep connection to the culture and 
history of each region, Bards serve as living archives of lore, art, and emotion.
	While not essential for progression, they add atmosphere, insight, and sometimes subtle advantages to players who take the time to listen.
	In some rare cases, Bards may also play a role in quests, special events, or local celebrations, making them versatile social figures in tavern life.

		Functions & Mechanics

1. Lore & Storytelling :
	* Provide historical or mythological background tied to their region.
	* Occasionally unlock “Lore Entries” in the player’s codex/journal after key conversations.

2. Quest Integration :
	* Some Bards initiate or advance quests, especially those tied to cultural discovery, lost artifacts, or ancient songs.
	* Certain main quests may require listening to a Bard’s tale to uncover hidden coordinates or clues.

3. Event Participation :
	* During regional festivals or global events, Bards may perform special songs and act as vendors of cosmetic or collectible items.

4. Performance Buffs (Selected Bards Only) :
	* A few notable Bards provide temporary buffs (e.g., morale, stamina, inspiration) to players after a performance.
	* These effects are minor and thematic — e.g., "Song of Courage" increases combat morale slightly for 30 minutes.
	* Buffs are limited to the Bard’s audience radius inside the tavern and do not stack.

5. Reputation Links :
	* Some Bards may only open dialogue or reveal their deeper stories once the player’s reputation with the local tavern keeper or region reaches a certain 
threshold.
