			# 📜 **NPC Core File: Regional Governors & Envoy NPCs**

### **Lore Introduction**

Throughout the world’s divided realms, power does not rest in shifting politics or fleeting councils — it is preserved in bloodlines, vows, and ancient oaths.
The Regional Governors and Envoys are the custodians of these eternal orders, chosen not merely to rule, but to embody the spirit and law of their lands.
Each governs a region bound by heritage — the King who unites continents, the immortal who guards the shadows, the warrior who defends the frozen wastes.
Their rule is not questioned, for it predates nations and outlasts empires.
They stand as silent pillars of balance, shaping the destiny of their domains without ever stepping beyond the edges of legend.

## I. Overview

**NPC Type:** Regional Governor / Envoy
**Category:** Side-Class NPC
**Affiliation:** Regional or Racial Authorities
**Alignment:** Neutral or Faction-Aligned (non-playable)
**Primary Role:** Lore and event figures, occasionally quest providers in specific storylines.

**Description:**
Regional Governors and Envoys are the sovereign figures, local rulers, and symbolic leaders who govern specific regions or racial domains across the continents.
While their presence commands respect, they are not designed for routine player interaction. Instead, they serve as narrative anchors—embodying history, culture, and power.

These NPCs may appear during global or regional events, major story chapters, or realm-wide changes, offering players a glimpse of the higher powers that shape the world’s fate.
Some of them act as figureheads only, while others are partially interactive through special questlines or scripted dialogues.

## IV. Lore & Worldbuilding Role

Regional Governors and Envoys embody the legacy and authority of their respective realms.
Each represents a unique cultural or racial lineage, reinforcing the world’s diversity and power hierarchy.
They act as fixed narrative points, preserving the realm’s identity while guiding the story’s atmosphere through their presence.

Their palaces, citadels, or seats of power often define the architectural and social essence of their regions, influencing how players perceive and navigate each territory.
