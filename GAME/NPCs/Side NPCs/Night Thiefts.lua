			Trickster NPCs – Core Summary File

		1. Introduction

	Trickster NPCs or also called "Night Thiefts" are unique, locally-triggered entities that appear exclusively within "Bayswick’s Grand Square", located in the 
"Dendera Continent – Garland Region III – Sharpthorne main area".
	They are not part of any visible world event or official activity. Instead, their presence represents unpredictable moments of mischief and illusion that break 
the monotony of the city’s daily rhythm.

	These NPCs are rare, temporary appearances, often catching players off guard with harmless pranks, cryptic words, or confusing acts.
	While their nature remains mysterious, locals speak of them as manifestations of the city’s restless spirit—a whimsical echo of Bayswick’s hidden undercurrents.

		2. Shared Traits & Behavioral Framework

	Spawn Conditions	

* Appear only within Bayswick’s Grand Square and never anywhere else.
* Their spawn is triggered by hidden variables, including:
	* Specific night-time hours or weather patterns.
	* Presence of outlaw-aligned players.
	* Players with notable reputation levels (very high or very low).
	* Players carrying certain rare or special items that have side effects linked to Trickster spawns.
	* **Distant events occurring on Middlean Island (Capital City) that ripple across the world and subtly influence the city.

* Their appearance frequency is unpredictable, with long intervals of inactivity between spawns.

	Appearance & Style

* They take on eccentric, theatrical forms : masked jesters, cloaked wanderers, or luminous illusionists.
* Their eyes often shimmer or glow faintly in the night, reflecting their unnatural nature.
* Never remain in one spot for long — they drift through the square, humming, performing tricks, or speaking to unseen figures.

	Behavior & Interaction

* Approach players directly or call out from a distance, initiating a short interaction.
* May “pretend” to steal an equipped or inventory item as part of their trick — the item is never lost or modified.
	* Within one hour, the player receives a private message (PM) notifying that the “joke has ended,” and the item can be recovered at the Mailbox in Bayswick.

* No damage, theft, or permanent change occurs; these encounters are entirely cosmetic and atmospheric.
* They may also vanish mid-conversation, reappear elsewhere, or disappear entirely without explanation.

	Combat & PvP

* Tricksters can be flagged for PvP, allowing players to attempt to chase or attack them.
* If attacked, they evade or teleport away using illusion-based effects.
* Upon defeat, the NPC disappears instantly in a burst of light or smoke — leaving no loot, reward, or record of their defeat.
* Guards and other city NPCs do not react to their presence or the conflict.

		3. Shared Functions & Mechanics

	Core Functionalities

* Spawn & Despawn System : Triggered by hidden player or environmental conditions; despawns automatically after the interaction ends.
* Trick Interaction System : Temporarily removes an item and later returns it via local mailbox, accompanied by an in-game message.
* Illusion Mechanics : May vanish, clone themselves, or emit visual and sound effects like laughter, smoke, or glowing trails.
* No Quest or Reward Links : Their presence is purely narrative and atmospheric; defeating or interacting with them does not grant items, experience, or reputation.
* Silent Influence System : Their spawn may coincide with unrelated activities in the world (for example, disturbances caused by Middlean Island events), but 
without explicit player-facing links.

		4. Purpose in World Design

Trickster NPCs serve as a hidden layer of world depth—small, unpredictable phenomena that make Bayswick feel alive and responsive.
Their presence breaks the rigidity of normal NPC behavior, adding mystery and unpredictability to the world’s living systems.
For new players, they create curiosity; for veterans, they act as reminders that even in familiar cities, the world still hides secrets beneath its surface.
