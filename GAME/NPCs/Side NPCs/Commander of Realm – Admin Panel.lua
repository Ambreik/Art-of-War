			Commander of Realm – Admin Panel

		1. Overview

	The "Commander of Realm" is a unique, high-authority NPC class reserved exclusively for game administrators, GMs, SGM, and the game owner.
	They are the embodiment of divine authority and world balance, representing each region’s spiritual or elemental essence.
	These entities serve as both in-world lore figures and technical control hubs, allowing staff to manage the game’s live environment discreetly and thematically.

	Each Commander manifests differently depending on the region, ensuring they naturally blend into the local culture while remaining unmistakably powerful 
presences.

		3. Regional Appearances

	Each "Commander of Realm" manifests in a unique form that reflects the nature, culture, and elemental influence of the region they oversee. Their appearance 
symbolizes their dominion and embodies the spirit of the land they guard.

	Dendera :
*Appears as a noble "Paladin", clad in radiant silver armor engraved with divine runes. His armor glows faintly with golden light, representing purity, valor, and 
divine justice. He wields a longsword that emanates a soft holy aura, symbolizing the disciplined strength of Dendera’s people.

	Zonen :
*Takes the form of a mighty "Werewolf Commander", armored in gleaming half-plate that blends savagery and discipline. His bestial frame is tempered by an aura of 
calm authority and wisdom, embodying Zonen’s balance between primal power and loyalty.

around him. He represents endurance, patience, and the silent strength of winter.

	Lagooma Jungle :

The wyrm embodies agility, freedom, and the untamed power of wind and storm.

	Tenebress Territory :
*Takes the form of a "Magma Entity", humanoid yet molten, its body cracked with glowing rivers of lava beneath dark, stone-like skin. Embers flicker with each 
movement. It radiates raw destructive energy, representing chaos, rebirth, and the eternal flame of conflict.

	Underworld Realm :
*Appears as a "Shadow Knight", mounted upon a spectral horse cloaked in dark smoke. His armor is jagged and blackened, with crimson light burning through his visor.
He embodies vengeance, judgment, and the eternal vigil of the underworld’s guardians.

	Underwater Realm :

echoes through the deep. She represents wisdom, serenity, and the eternal rhythm of the sea.

		6. Dialogue and Lore Integration

	While the core functions are administrative, the NPC also carries in-character dialogue to preserve immersion:

> "I am the hand of the Realm. Through me, the balance endures."
> "This land’s heartbeat echoes through my will — let harmony be restored."
> "The storm gathers, and I shall be its judge."
> "Peace is but a moment between the tides of fate."

	If interacted with by a normal player (without permissions):

> "You feel a great power observing you — but it turns away, as if waiting for another."
