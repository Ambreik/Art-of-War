			Elara - Relic Breaker

---

		1. Overview

	"Elara – Relic Breaker" is a mysterious woman who wanders the "Dragon Isle" of the "Middlean Islands".
	Once a gifted sage of the old world, she was among the few who drank from the "Living Water" during the "Second Great War", seeking enlightenment to aid 
humanity.
	However, the overwhelming surge of divine knowledge and immortality fractured her mind and body, leaving her trapped between stability and chaos.

	Now, "Elara" roams the world in unpredictable intervals, wielding the power to unbind objects from their owners — freeing them from spiritual or magical 
constraints.
	Her presence is seen as both a blessing and a danger, for where she walks, the air hums with unbalanced energy.

		2. Location and Spawn Mechanics

* Region : Middlean Islands
* Specific Area : Dragon Isle
* Behavior : Wandering NPC — roams freely across the island.
* Spawn Frequency : Random; may appear once per day or multiple times within unpredictable intervals.
* Active Duration : Randomized between 5 minutes and several hours.
* Extended Presence Mechanic :
	* Each time a player interacts with her successfully, her current stay extends by +3 minutes.
	* Every interaction that involves an unbinding resets a personal cooldown for that player of 10 minutes.

* Combat Stance :
	* Can be attacked and targeted in PvP or PvE combat.
	* Uses powerful defensive abilities if attacked, capable of neutralizing or escaping when threatened.

		3. Appearance

	Elara possesses an otherworldly beauty that defies time.
	Her long silver-blonde hair flows like liquid moonlight, her eyes faintly glowing with shifting runes of blue and violet.
	She wears layered robes of translucent fabric, shimmering with faint gold threads — reminiscent of ancient ceremonial attire.
	Her hands are always faintly illuminated, as if the Living Water still courses visibly beneath her skin.

	When idle, small motes of light drift around her body. When interacting with a player, these motes surge and pulse like ripples on water.

		4. Behavior and Presence

* Roams naturally around Dragon Isle, pausing occasionally near water sources, ruins, or dragon statues.
* When approached, her head slowly turns toward the player, and faint whispering echoes are heard.
* Randomly mutters fragmented phrases related to knowledge, immortality, and freedom.
* If left idle too long without interaction, she fades away in a burst of blue light.

		5. Primary Function – Item Unbinding

	Elara’s gift is the "Unbinding Ritual", allowing her to remove restrictions placed upon items.
	This ability reflects her mastery over the threads of existence, gained through her contact with the "Living Water".

	Mechanics :

1. The player interacts and selects the "Unbind Item" option.
2. A unique ritual interface appears where the player can drag an eligible item.
3. The ritual requires a special catalyst item (to be defined in future development, placeholder: "Essence of the Living Water").
4. After confirmation, the ritual begins:
	* Blue energy surrounds the item.
	* The screen darkens slightly as a whisper echoes:
		> "The thread weakens… it breaks."
	* The binding (e.g., Bound to Account, Bound on Pickup) is permanently removed.
   
5. The item becomes freely tradable or transferable.

	Restrictions and Safety :
* Cannot unbind unique quest items, legendary relics, or lore-specific artifacts.
* Unbinding one item triggers a 10-minute cooldown per account.
* Each successful unbinding extends Elara’s presence on the island by 3 minutes.
* All unbinding actions are logged by the system.

		6. Dialogue and Interaction

	Idle Lines :
* "Threads… so many threads… all tangled and forgotten."
* "He still calls for me from the water… the one who erased what I freed."
* "The Living Water grants eternity, but not peace."
* "You carry chains upon your soul… shall I cut them?"

	Interaction Lines :
* "Show me what binds you, and I shall make it breathe again."
* "It remembers you… but you do not remember it. Let me fix that."
* "This will hurt… but only for a moment."
* "The thread is severed. It belongs to the world once more."

	Combat Response Lines (if attacked) :
* "You dare strike the hand that unbinds?"
* "Even death cannot chain me again."
* "I have seen the world end twice. You are not its third."

		7. Role in Lore

	Elara was once one of the "Living Water Sages", a small order of humans who sought divine understanding to aid humanity during the "Second Great War".
	They believed that drinking the "Living Water" would grant wisdom and power equal to that of the gods.
	Instead, it cursed them — gifting them immortality and warping their perception of time, reality, and morality.

	Now fragmented across the continents, these sages wander the world, each embodying a unique distortion of the knowledge they once pursued.
	Elara represents "Liberation through Knowledge", a contrast to her counterpart "Lunatic Guy", who embodies "Destruction through Madness".

	Their existence is a reminder of humanity’s arrogance in seeking godhood — and the eternal cost that followed.
