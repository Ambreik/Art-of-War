			Spirit Healer — NPC Core File

---

### **I. Introduction**

The **Spirit Healers** are otherworldly beings residing within the **Underworld Realm**, serving as guides between life and death. They are neutral, ethereal entities unaligned with any faction, bound by ancient laws of balance.
Spirit Healers exist beyond the mortal plane — neither living nor dead — and their presence signifies the eternal cycle between the two realms. Their role is to aid adventurers who have perished, offering them a chance to return to life at a spiritual cost.

### **II. Visual Description**

**Appearance**

* **Form**: Semi-transparent humanoid figures floating slightly above the ground, composed of silvery-white light with hues of blue and gold.
* **Wings**: Large, radiant wings of pure energy with no feathers, emitting soft pulses of light that leave shimmering trails.
* **Clothing**: Flowing robes made of living energy, shifting like smoke, etched with glowing celestial markings.
* **Face**: Smooth, featureless visage with glowing eyes like twin stars; mouths move only when they speak.
* **Aura**: Surrounded by a soft mist and a gentle, harmonic hum symbolizing their connection to the Underworld.

**Behavior**

* Constantly levitates in calm serenity, radiating peace even amid chaos.
* Speaks in soft, echoing tones as though from multiple planes at once.
* Unflinching and unthreatened — impervious to combat and worldly influence.

### **III. Lore and Origin**

When the **Underworld Realm** was first created — a chaotic liminal space between life and death — lost souls wandered aimlessly, preyed upon by horrors of the void.
The **Ethereal Pantheon**, a council of ancient benevolent spirits, forged the **Spirit Healers** to restore order and guide the lost.

They embody the bridge between realms, ensuring the natural passage of souls and preserving balance.
Bound by neutrality, they cannot interfere in mortal struggles but offer aid to those in despair. Their continued existence is proof of the balance the universe demands — where **life and death mirror one another**.
