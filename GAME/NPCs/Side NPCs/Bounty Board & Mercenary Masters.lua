			Bounty Board & Mercenary Masters

---

## **I. Introduction**

**Bounty Board & Mercenary Masters** are neutral yet essential NPCs that govern the *Bounty Hunter Profession* and manage the system of contracts, hunts, and mercenary work across the realms.
They serve as intermediaries between the player and the shadow organization known as **The Concord of Blades** — a syndicate that oversees bounty distribution, reward integrity, and the training of professional hunters.

Operating independently from all political or racial authorities, these NPCs embody discipline, discretion, and deadly efficiency. They are not heroes or villains — merely professionals ensuring that every contract is honored, and every debt is paid in blood or coin.

Their presence introduces the player to a global system of **contracts, bounties, and mercenary rankings**, enabling participation in world hunts, outlaw eliminations, and high-risk monster tracking missions.

## **II. General Description**

Bounty Boards are stationary interfaces or structures placed in strategic areas — taverns, forts, guard stations, or city squares — where adventurers may accept or review available contracts.
Each board reflects the regional dangers or criminal activity of the area, dynamically updating its postings as events unfold.

Mercenary Masters, on the other hand, are **living NPCs** who act as the human (or non-human) counterpart to the Boards.
They provide specialized training, issue personal or confidential contracts, and manage the player’s **Bounty Reputation (B-REP)** and profession progression.

While the Boards represent public bounty work, the Masters are the keepers of private and elite hunts — jobs that demand skill, loyalty, and discretion.
