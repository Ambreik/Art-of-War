			NPC Tier System – World Game 


		Tier I – Core / High-Impact NPCs

	Description : Tier I NPCs are essential to player progression and core game mechanics. They are commonly found in all human settlements or central hubs. Most 
Tier I NPCs are integrated with the REP system, meaning their full range of services unlocks as players build a relationship with them.

	General Mechanics :

* PvP Immunity : Fully immune to PvP attacks; cannot be flagged or damaged by players unless is scripted otherwise.
* Skillable / Combat : Can fight back defensively if designed as skillable (e.g., Guardians).
* Survivability : Cannot die under normal circumstances; essential for gameplay continuity.
* Quest / Service Access : Core services always available; some services require REP progression.
* Special Mechanics : Buffs, teleportation, mount management, or city respawn.

	NPC Classes :

* Guardians / Guards – Protect settlements, provide guidance, optional REP benefits.
* Primary Profession Trainers – Fisherman, Miner, Hunter ; rank-based training; REP unlocks advanced tools.
* Stable Masters – Mount acquisition, training, upgrades; REP unlocks rare mounts.
* Tavern Keepers – Rest, food, buffs, quests; REP Rank II+ unlocks dungeon/rare monster info.

			NPC Tier System – Extended Mechanics

		1. Interaction Mechanics

	Dialogue and Interaction
* NPCs interact with players via dialogue menus for quests, trades, or services.
* Dialogue can be dynamic, changing based on:
  * REP rank with the NPC
  * Quest progression
  * Time of day or special conditions

	Proximity / Trigger Zones
* NPCs become interactive only within a defined radius.
* Some NPCs require special items (Favor items) to unlock additional functionality or secret options.
	* Example: Giving a golden apple to a female merchant NPC adds a rare item to her shop in exchange for a specific currency.
	* Favor items can also increase REP with the NPC or unlock hidden quests.
* Conditional interactions can be tied to REP, item possession, or quest status, making some content secret or rare.

	Timers / Cooldowns
* Buffs or temporary bonuses are not standard; only scripted for specific NPCs.
* Cooldowns can apply to rare services or secret item unlocks to prevent exploitation.

	Interaction Restrictions
* Tier I and II NPCs are immune to PvP by default, but enemy faction players can attack them under certain rules.
* Tier III/IV NPCs are not immune; they can be killed or attacked to access special drops (like outlaw or rare items).

	Dynamic Dialogue Based on REP or Quest Status
* Dialogue changes based on REP rank or quest progression.
* NPCs may reference player actions, provide hints for secrets, or unlock unique services/items.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		2. Tier-Based Loot / Rewards

	Reward Guidelines by Tier

* Tier I – Core / High-Impact NPCs
	* Grants essential quest items, crafting materials, or tools.
	* Rare drops possible only in specific scenarios (enemy faction PvP, scripted events).
	* Unlockable content tied to REP progression, e.g., rare profession recipes or mount inventory expansions.

* Tier II – Important / Specialized NPCs
	* Grants specialized items, quest rewards, or rare collectibles.
	* REP may unlock exclusive inventory, quests, or services (e.g., Arena Manager PvP rewards).
	* Tier II NPCs like Pet Masters and Mount Masters:
		* Store pets/mounts for players.
		* Storage capacity and inventory options increase with REP or depending on the location of the NPC.
		* Provide pet/mount-related quests.

* Tier III – Minor / Quest or Event NPCs
	* Offer hidden, seasonal, or event-based rewards.
	* Rare drops and secret rewards possible, tied to player actions, timing, or quest completion.
	* Can be killed for special drops (outlaws, rare NPCs).

* Tier IV – Ambient / Filler NPCs
	* Minor flavor items or trivial currency only.
	* Primarily for immersion; interaction optional.

	Additional Notes

* Favor items can also trigger hidden loot or shop unlocks, giving players rare access or secret content.
* Some NPCs can have conditional PvP drops.
* Outlaw NPCs or special event NPCs may have unique loot when killed or interacted with under special conditions.

		3. Reputation (REP) Mechanics

	The REP system measures the relationship between a player and an NPC (or faction). It affects access to services, quests, rare items, or secrets.

	Key Mechanics :

* REP Gain :
	* Completing NPC quests or helping the NPC/faction.
	* Trading, training, or giving "Favor items" to NPCs.
	* Special event participation (e.g., assisting Tavern Keeper during a rare monster hunt).

* REP Loss :
	* Attacking or stealing from the NPC.
	* Failing critical quests or sabotaging faction objectives.
	* Killing NPCs that are part of a protected system (Tier I/II core NPCs).

* REP Effects :
	* Unlock additional dialogue options, hidden quests, and secret services.
	* Expand inventory or storage capacity for Pet/Mount Masters.
	* Unlock rare items in shops (triggered by Favor items or REP thresholds).
	* Provide access to advanced training, recipes, or event areas.

* REP Levels / Ranks :
	* Example: Rank I → Recruit, Rank II → Craftsman, Rank III → Expert, Rank IV → Artisan, Rank V → Grand Master
	* REP Rank thresholds may vary depending on the NPC’s tier and type.

* Conditional Interaction via REP :
	* Some Tier II/III NPCs only reveal hidden dialogue, quests, or shops when REP or specific Favor items are present.
	* Example: Giving a rare gem to a Biologist NPC unlocks a secret quest chain.

* Enemy-Faction and Conditional Drops :
	* Enemy-faction players may reduce REP or gain special PvP opportunities by attacking NPCs.
	* Certain NPCs drop rare items only under specific conditions (e.g., enemy faction kills, seasonal events, or outlaws).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		4. Combat / Skillable NPC Rules

	NPC behavior in combat is determined by tier, type, and game context.

	General Rules by Tier :

* Tier I (Core / High-Impact) :
	* PvP Behavior : Immune to PvP in normal circumstances. Can defend if scripted or attacked by enemy-faction players.
	* Skillable Combat : Optional defensive abilities; e.g., Guardians may attack hostile NPCs or enemy faction players.
	* Survivability : Cannot die under normal gameplay; invulnerable except under scripted events or enemy-faction attacks.
	* Special Drops : Rare, conditional, or event-based.

* Tier II (Specialized / Important) :
	* PvP Behavior : Usually immune; can be attacked in controlled environments (arena events, enemy-faction interactions).
	* Skillable Combat : Can defend themselves; some NPCs (Arena Manager minions, Pet/Mount Masters) may fight back if attacked in specific scenarios.
	* Survivability : Moderate; NPC may retreat, call for help, or be temporarily incapacitated.
	* Special Drops : Can drop rare items in certain conditions or when killed by enemy-faction players.

* Tier III (Minor / Quest or Event) :
	* PvP Behavior : Vulnerable; can be killed for special drops or quests.
	* Skillable Combat : Optional; may flee or have minimal defensive abilities.
	* Survivability : Low; NPC may die permanently or respawn on timers.
	* Special Drops : Hidden items, event-specific collectibles, or quest triggers.

* Tier IV (Ambient / Filler) :
	* PvP Behavior : Fully vulnerable; no special defense.
	* Skillable Combat : None; purely decorative.
	* Survivability : Minimal; no impact on gameplay if killed.

	Additional Combat / Skillable Mechanics :

* Aggro Management :
	* Tier I/II NPCs generally ignore non-hostile players and low-level threats.
	* Tier III/IV NPCs may be attacked by players or hostile NPCs.

* Conditional PvP Drops :
	* Enemy-faction attacks may grant special loot, rare materials, or quest triggers.
	* Outlaw NPCs (or player-targeted NPCs) may drop unique items for faction players or during events.

* Scripted Combat / Events :
	* Some NPCs may fight only during specific events (arena fights, world invasions, or rare monster attacks).
	* Pet/Mount Masters do not provide battle mechanics; combat is optional and only defensive.
