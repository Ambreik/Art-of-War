			Old Man Garron – The Wandering Thief

		1. Introduction

	"Old Man Garron" is a singular, world-unique NPC known across the continents as the "Wandering Thief".
	Unlike ordinary town residents, Garron does not belong to any faction or settlement; he appears spontaneously within human cities and villages, moving freely 
through open streets, alleyways, and accessible buildings.
	His behavior is unpredictable yet deliberate — he observes players from a distance, selecting a random target to attempt a theft.
	This mysterious vagabond embodies the essence of chaos in civilized places: a harmless-looking old man whose presence is both amusing and alarming.

		2. Location, Appearance & Behavior

	Spawn Behavior :
* Old Man Garron can appear in any major human settlement, wandering as part of normal foot traffic.
* He favors crowded markets, tavern districts, and narrow alleys, making his detection difficult until he acts.
* He can enter most publicly accessible interiors, such as taverns, workshops, or guild halls.

	Visual Description :
* Garron is an elderly man of small stature, hunched beneath the weight of a large, bulging backpack.
* He wears oversized, worn-out shoes, a crooked hat reminiscent of a jester’s cap, and a patchwork coat stitched from mismatched cloths.
* His long gray mustache curls upward mischievously, and his eyes glint with cunning intelligence.

	Personality & Interaction Style :
* Though labeled a thief, Garron is far from silent — he mocks, jokes, and teases his victims with playful lines during encounters.
* He often laughs when spotted or when his theft fails, sometimes sending players short pre-written chat messages like:

> "Too slow, youngster — these hands may tremble, but they’re quicker than your eyes!"
> "It’s only a borrowing, not a stealing, eh? I’ll bring it back… someday."

	These interactions add life to his presence and make each encounter memorable rather than purely mechanical.

	Guard & NPC Awareness :
* City guards and other protective NPCs ignore Garron under normal conditions.
* However, once he successfully loots a player or is spotted mid-theft, they immediately shift into pursuit mode, chasing him through the streets.
* If caught, Garron surrenders and the stolen item is recovered and delivered to the city’s local mailbox for the victim to reclaim.

		3. Functions & Mechanics

	Core Function :
* Old Man Garron serves as a dynamic theft NPC whose purpose is to bring unpredictability and activity into populated zones.
* He is capable of targeting random nearby players and initiating his unique ability — "Looting in Progress".

	Looting in Progress (Ability) :

* When targeting a player, a progress bar appears in the center of that player’s screen, lasting 10 seconds.
* During this period, the player can interrupt the process by moving away, using combat abilities, or alerting a nearby guard NPC.
* If the player breaks the looting attempt, Garron becomes afflicted with a "Slowdown debuff" and is revealed on the minimap for 5 minutes.
* Guards and defensive NPCs become aware of his position during this time and may engage him on sight.

	If Garron completes the theft successfully:

* The player receives a system message notifying which item was stolen.
* Garron immediately flees, seeking a hiding place somewhere within the same settlement.
* The stolen item remains unrecoverable until Garron is captured or defeated.

	Item Recovery & Combat :

* Players or guards who defeat Garron in combat recover the stolen item, which is automatically mailed to the victim.
* Garron is fully skillable in combat; though frail in appearance, he possesses high evasion, moderate damage, and several crowd-control skills such as 
"Smoke Escape", "Blind Dust", and "Tripwire Toss".

	PvP and Bounty System :

* Players who are victims can place a bounty on Garron’s head through the Bounty Hunters’ board.
* Successful Bounty Hunters who capture or defeat him gain "Reputation", 5 Gold Coins, and a rare reward item tied to their profession.
* Garron remains on the Bounty List for 2 hours after each theft attempt before disappearing again.

	Despawning & Persistence :

* Garron despawns naturally if the targeted player disconnects or after 2 hours without being found or defeated.
* In such cases, the stolen item is permanently lost.
* Once despawned, he may randomly respawn in a different settlement at an unspecified time.

	Communication Behavior :

* Garron occasionally sends predefined private messages (PMs) to players after stealing or escaping, written in his distinctive humorous tone.
  Examples include:

  > "Ah, the thrill of the chase! You almost had me that time."
  > "You can’t cage an old wind, my friend — I’ve been running since before you had shoes!"

	Global Notifications :

* When Garron successfully steals an item, a global message is broadcast to all players in that region, alerting them of the theft.
* A similar broadcast occurs if he is captured or defeated.
