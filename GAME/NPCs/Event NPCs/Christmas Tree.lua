			Christmas Tree

---

		1. Overview

	The "Christmas Tree" is a seasonal "Event Object NPC", inspired by traditional holiday celebrations. It appears in all major human settlements during the 
"Winter Euforia" period, serving both as a decorative centerpiece and as an interactive festive hub.
	Players can interact with the tree to receive gifts, buffs, or participate in time-limited seasonal quests and community events.

	Its purpose is to bring warmth, joy, and a sense of unity among players across all factions.

		2. General Description

	The "Christmas Tree" is a tall, majestic evergreen adorned with ornaments, ribbons, candles, and magical lights. It radiates a soft, ambient glow that brightens
the area around it, often accompanied by gentle snowfall or festive background music.

	Depending on the settlement, the decorations adapt slightly to reflect regional culture and materials (e.g., desert towns may use gold ribbons and lanterns,
while snowy regions feature frost crystals and ice ornaments).

	The tree serves as a non-combat, static event NPC — it cannot be attacked, destroyed, or moved.
