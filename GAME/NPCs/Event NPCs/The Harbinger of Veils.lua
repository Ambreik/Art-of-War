			The Harbinger of Veils

---

		1. Overview

	The "Harbinger of Veils" is the central figure of the "Halloween Event – Terror of the Underworld Spirits."
	Unlike traditional Halloween mascots, the Harbinger is a mysterious spectral entity that appears when the boundaries between realms weaken.
	Its arrival marks the beginning of the "Veil Season" — when the dead whisper to the living, and forgotten souls walk once more among mortals.

	It acts as a seasonal event NPC, quest giver, and ritual keeper, guiding players through the dark festivities and the chaos brought by the restless underworld 
spirits.

		2. Lore and Theme

> "When the thinnest night draws near, and the living dare whisper the names of the dead — the Harbinger listens."

	Once a celestial guardian of the border between worlds,the "Harbinger of Veils" now emerges during the season of shadows, drawn by the power of fear and memory.
	Its duty is to maintain the fragile barrier separating the living from the dead — yet each year, it invites adventurers to partake in rituals that strengthen 
(or weaken) that veil.

	During this time, specters, wraiths, and forgotten heroes wander the world, seeking release… or vengeance.
