		2. General Description

	A cheerful, magical creature dressed in festive attire — typically a tall bunny standing upright,with a colorful vest, a small satchel, and a mischievous smile.
	He carries a basket filled with glowing eggs, which occasionally sparkle or emit faint particle effects, hinting at hidden rewards across the world.

	The "Easter Bunny" radiates a soft pastel aura and is surrounded by lively ambient sounds: chirping birds, soft laughter, and jingling bells.

	He is a non-combat NPC object — static, friendly, and cannot be attacked or targeted for PvP.
