	Functions and Mechanics :   
- Item Upgrading :   
	Blacksmiths are crucial for improving the quality of weapons, armor, and accessories by increasing their level. The upgrading process depends on specific 
materials and gold, which the player must provide.  
- Success and Failure Rates :   
	- Upgrading is not guaranteed. Higher-level upgrades have an increased chance of "failure", and in some cases, failure may result in:  
		- "Item degradation" (lowering its level).  
		- "Complete destruction" of the item (unless a protective item is used).  
	- Players can use special items such as:  
		- "Reinforcement Stones" to boost success rates.  
		- "Protection Perchants" to prevent item destruction.  
- "Crafting Assistance :   
	Blacksmiths can craft or improve materials needed for upgrades, including "Blacksmith Perchants" or other enhancement tools.  
- "Quests and Reputation :   
	While primarily focused on crafting and upgrading, Blacksmiths occasionally act as "quest givers", particularly for tasks requiring material gathering. 

- "Regional Variations" : 
	- Each region’s Blacksmith may have unique traits or services:
		- For example, a Blacksmith in "Lagooma Jungle" might use exotic materials , while one in "Tenebress Territory" could specialize in forging weapons from 
		volcanic metals.

	Legendary Blacksmiths : 
- Blacksmiths do not craft "Legendary Equipment".
- Such tasks are reserved for "Legendary Blacksmiths", rare and powerful NPCs with exclusive quests, recipes, and skills.
- Legendary Blacksmiths often have unique lore tied to their abilities and might require extensive effort or reputation to access.
- They are found only in major cities in "Outland Territories" and "Capital City"
