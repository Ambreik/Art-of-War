	3. Pet Master Services

- Skill/Ability Perchants :  
	Pet Masters sell scrolls or items that allow pets to learn new skills or upgrade their existing abilities. These items are purchased with various types of in-
game currency.
  
- Pet Transformation :  
	Pet Masters can change the type or specialization of a pet for a fee. This can include changing a pet’s combat abilities, appearance, or role (e.g., from a 
defensive pet to a damage-dealing pet).
  
- Pet Revival :  
	In the case of a pet's death (usually for hunter pets), the Pet Master can revive the pet, but a special fee is required, often involving a rare flower or 
ingredient distinct from those used for horses.
  
- Pet Storage :  
	Players can store up to 50 pets with the Pet Master. The player must provide daily food for their pets while stored, which can be pre-paid in advance. If a 
player wants to retrieve a pet, they must travel to the Pet Master and release the pet. In some cases, a small fee or goods may be required for the release of a 
stored pet if the daily fee was not paid.
