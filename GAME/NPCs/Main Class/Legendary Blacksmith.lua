			Legendary Blacksmith

	The "Legendary Blacksmith" is a rare and powerful NPC revered for their unmatched craftsmanship and mastery in forging "Legendary Equipment".
	These artisans represent the highest tier of the "Blacksmith Profession System", standing as the only beings capable of shaping weapons, armor, and accessories 
that transcend mortal craftsmanship.
	They embody both knowledge and mystery — respected by all, feared by some — and are sought after by players who have reached the pinnacle of crafting and 
progression.

	"Legendary Blacksmiths" are neutral, accessible by both factions (Knights and Pindars), and can often be found sharing their forges with standard "Blacksmiths" 
in major cities, though their presence commands far greater prestige.

	Locations

* Found exclusively in "Capital City" (Middlean Islands) and major cities across the "Outland Territories".
* Often share the same district or structure as standard "Blacksmiths", though their workspace is grander, imbued with magical flames and rare materials.
* Accessible by both factions and considered neutral NPCs in all regions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Appearance & Environment

* "Legendary Blacksmiths" work within specialized forges that glow with arcane fire and hum with energy from molten metals.
* Their environments reflect their regional domain — a volcanic forge in "Tenebress", crystal-lined anvils in "Frozen Territory", or wind-cooled bellows in the 
"Middlean Isles".
* Around them lie rare ores, enchanted molds, and ancient relics, symbolizing their link between craftsmanship and magic.
* A radiant "Forge Seal" often marks their workshop, serving as both an aesthetic emblem and an aura of prestige.

		Functions & Mechanics

	1. Crafting Legendary Equipment

* "Legendary Blacksmiths" are the only NPCs capable of evolving "Epic Equipment" into "Legendary Equipment".
* Crafting requires:
	* Epic base item (upgraded to its maximum level).
	* Legendary Recipe (specific to the item type).
	* Rare materials (regional or boss-related).
	* High crafting fee in gold and crafting currency.
* Success rates vary based on the player’s "Blacksmith Profession Rank", regional Reputation (REP), and specific enhancement materials used.
* Failure may destroy or downgrade the base Epic item unless protected by a "Safeguard Essence".

	2. Crafting Legendary Craft Supplies

* These masters can forge "Legendary Craft Supplies" — rare consumable items that enhance success rates or quality in crafting done by standard Blacksmiths.
* Examples include enhancement boosters, reinforcement reagents, and refinement tools with a higher success probability.
* The higher the player’s "Blacksmith Profession Rank", the more potent and varied the supplies available to craft.

	3. Repair Functionality

* "Legendary Blacksmiths" offer "Repair Services" that scale not only with item quality but also with the player’s regional "Reputation"(REP) and "Profession Rank".
* Repair cost and efficiency depend on:
	* "Item Quality Tier" (Basic, Rare, Epic, Legendary).
	* "Player REP" (higher REP lowers repair costs).
	* "Player Profession Rank" (Blacksmith players enjoy increased efficiency).
* "Legendary Equipment" is immune to standard durability loss and therefore cannot be repaired — it is self-sustaining through its magical essence.

	4. Profession Integration: Blacksmith Teacher

* Acts as a "Blacksmith Profession Mentor", unlocking once a player reaches "Rank III" in their primary profession and has already selected a secondary profession.
* Grants access to advanced "Blacksmith" recipes, Legendary blueprints, and exclusive crafting techniques unavailable elsewhere.
* Profession recipes are divided into:
	* Common Recipes : shared across all "Legendary Blacksmiths".
	* Regional Recipes : unique to the area where the "Legendary Blacksmith" resides, encouraging exploration and specialization.
* This function is not marked on the map under "Profession Teachers" — players must discover them through exploration, lore, or questlines.

	5. Questgiver Role

* Provides high-level profession quests tied to legendary materials, crafting mastery, or unique world events.
* Some quests unlock "Legendary Recipes", while others improve "Blacksmith Profession Rank" or grant forging reputation with that specific "Legendary Blacksmith".
* Storyline quests may reveal the origin of legendary crafting materials or involve forging a weapon tied to lore.

	6. Shop

* Functions as a specialized shop, selling:
	* Rare crafting materials (bound or unbound).
	* Legendary blueprints and reagents.
	* Protective and enhancement items for "Epic" upgrades.
* Prices and availability scale with player Reputation and "Profession Rank", ensuring progression-based reward balance.

	7. Player Interactions & Messages

* "Legendary Blacksmiths" feature unique interaction lines depending on the player’s Reputation, profession level, and relationship.
	Examples:
		"Only those who’ve proven their hands worthy may touch the fire of legends"
		"Your hammer rings with promise… but promise alone doesn’t forge greatness"
		"I sense the weight of the world in your steel. Shall we make it sing once more?"
		"Hah! Even flames bow to mastery. Let’s see if yours can endure"
		"Your reputation precedes you, craftsman. Let’s make something worthy of it"

	8. Combat and Skillability

* Legendary Blacksmiths are skillable NPCs and can only be attacked in "PvP stance".
* If attacked, they may:
	* Temporarily become unavailable for service.
	* Call nearby "Guardians" or city guards for assistance.
	* Record the player’s aggression in the local reputation system, leading to temporary service bans.
