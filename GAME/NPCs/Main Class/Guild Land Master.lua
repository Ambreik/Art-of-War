			Guild Land Master

		1. Introduction & Role Overview

	"Guild Land Masters" are specialized administrative NPCs responsible for managing the relationship between player guilds and the lands they own.
	They act as official mediators between the realm’s governing bodies and player organizations, overseeing the purchase, maintenance, and progression of 
"Guild Lands".
	Their primary role is to sell guild territories to qualified "Guild Leaders", enabling guilds to establish, expand, and manage their own land holdings.
	
	Beyond sales, they also serve as the main access point for teleportation to guild lands, management of guild progression systems, and information distribution 
regarding guild-level statistics and resources.

	In addition to their administrative duties, "Guild Land Masters" function as guardians and overseers of major settlements.
	They stand watch over populated areas, ensuring order, and can even be targeted by outlawed or rival players — granting PvP points upon defeat, though their 
fall has no lasting narrative consequence beyond system notification.

		2. Core Functions

	"Guild Land Masters" serve as the central administrative and support hub for all guild-related land management activities within the world. Their main functions
include:

* Guild Land Sales : 
	Authorize and sell parcels of land exclusively to "Guild Leaders". Each guild may only own one active land at a time, and the purchase must be confirmed through
the "Guild Land Master"’s interface.

* Teleportation Services :
	Instantly teleport guild members to their respective Guild Land.
	The teleportation is free of charge, has no cooldown, and is available only to registered guild members of the owning guild.

* Guild Information Access :
	Provide detailed information about the guild’s status and development, including:
		* Guild Level and progression percentage
		* Land Level (expansion stage and size)
		* Donation funds and treasury status
		* Active daily, weekly, and monthly guild quests
		* List of NPCs employed within the Guild Land (e.g., vendors, trainers, crafters)

* Guidance and Information :
	Similar to "Guardian NPCs", "Guild Land Masters" can offer information about:
		* Settlement layout and directions to key NPCs
		* Quest-related hints or guidance
		* Regional rules, PvP status, and faction activity summaries

* Settlement Guardian Role :
	Act as defenders of their assigned settlements.
		* Can be attacked by rival faction players or outlaws for PvP points.
		* Their defeat triggers a system-wide notification for all online players in that faction, indicating who killed them and where, but does not cause lasting 
	world consequences.

	These combined roles make "Guild Land Masters" both vital bureaucratic figures and respected protectors of civilization — blending administrative depth with 
tactical world presence.

		3. Guild Management Interface

	The "Guild Land Master UI" provides a structured interface for managing and monitoring guild land and its associated functions. Key features include:

* Access Conditions :
	* Guild Leaders and Officers : Full access to all panels, including land management, NPC assignments, donations, and quest overview.
	* Regular Guild Members : Read-only access; can view guild stats, land level, active quests, and donation totals, but cannot make changes.

* Display Sections :
	* Guild Level Panel : Shows current guild level, experience points, and progress toward the next level.
	* Land Level Panel : Displays land expansion status, area size, and unlocked facilities.
	* Donations/Treasury Panel : Tracks contributions from guild members and overall funds available for land development.
	* NPC List Panel : Lists all NPCs employed within the Guild Land, including vendors, trainers, and other support staff.
	* Quest Progress Panel : Displays active daily, weekly, and monthly guild quests, progress completion, and available rewards.

* Non-Editable Panels for Members :
	* Members can see all current guild stats and contributions but cannot modify any values or assign tasks.
	* Provides transparency and awareness of guild development while restricting administrative control to leadership roles.

	This UI ensures guild leaders maintain full control over their land and its resources, while members remain informed without compromising governance.

		4. Quest & Progression Integration

	The "Guild Land Master" integrates directly with guild-level progression and questlines, offering both administrative and gameplay functions:

* Access to Guild Quests :
	* Grants leaders and officers the ability to assign or review daily, weekly, and monthly guild quests.
	* Quests focus on guild land development, resource management, or guild-specific objectives.

* Progress Tracking :
	* Automatically tracks guild completion of quests and activities that contribute to land level-ups and expansion milestones.
	* Displays progress visually in the "Guild Management Interface" for easy monitoring.

* Intermediary Role :
	* Acts as a central NPC for guild advancement tasks, allowing players to submit quest items, report completed objectives, or receive guidance on next steps.
	* Supports leaders in delegating tasks to guild members while maintaining oversight of overall progression.

	This system ensures the "Guild Land Master" functions as both a manager and facilitator of guild development, centralizing quest and progression tracking within
a single interface.
