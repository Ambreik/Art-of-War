	6. Additional Mechanics / Notes

* Tier I rules: Immune to standard PvP, skillable only against hostile NPCs or enemy-faction players
* Conditional REP: Players lose reputation for attacking guards; higher REP unlocks quests or special interactions
* Guards can defend against hostile mobs or assist players under certain conditions
* Part of a broader NPC system where Favor items, REP, and tier mechanics integrate with other NPCs (Pet/Mount Masters, Trainers, Tavern Keepers, etc.)
