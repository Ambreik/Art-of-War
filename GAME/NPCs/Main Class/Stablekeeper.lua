			Stablekeeper


		1. Introduction

	Overview : Stablekeepers are NPCs responsible for the care, healing, and training of horses, particularly military or special mounts that evolve into 
"Legendary Horses". They are typically found in human settlements, especially in villages. These NPCs are non-skillable but provide important services related to 
mounts, including healing, storage, and management.

	Additional Info / Mechanics :

* Tier : II – Important NPC for mount systems; cannot be flagged for PvP by default.
* Reputation (REP) : Players may increase REP with Stablekeepers by paying fees on time, providing rare food items, or completing mount-related quests. Higher REP 
can unlock discounts or access to rare horse care services.
* Favor Items : Rare items (e.g., rare hay, flowers, or grooming kits) may temporarily unlock enhanced healing or special services for mounts.
* Conditional Unlocks : Certain legendary mounts or advanced care options may require a high REP rank or specific Favor items.

* Healing : For a fee and a specific flower, Stablekeepers can heal and revive horses.
* Mount Retrieval : Players must travel to the Stablekeeper to retrieve their mount, and sometimes may have to pay additional fees or provide goods if the daily 
care fee was not paid.

* PvP Interaction : Stablekeepers are neutral NPCs and cannot be attacked or flagged for PvP under normal conditions.

		3. Appearance

	Description : Stablekeepers typically wear practical, horse-related attire, reflecting their connection with animal care and training. They may be seen with 
tools related to horse care (e.g., saddles, grooming kits).

	Location Appearance : Stablekeepers are found in or near stables, often within the same area as "Pet Masters". Their surroundings are filled with stables, hay, 
and other horse care items.

	Additional Info / Mechanics :
* Visual Cues : NPCs may display small icons or mounts nearby to signal services available (healing, storage, or special legendary horse care).
* Shared Location Mechanics : While they share space with Pet Masters, they are completely separate in functionality; players interact with each NPC individually.

		4. Location and Placement

	General Locations :

* Stablekeepers are located in nearly every "human settlement", especially in "villages" or areas known for animal care.
* Often found near the local "Pet Master", as they share a space where animals and mounts are managed.

	Additional Info / Mechanics :

* Tier : II – Important NPC for mounts; normally immune to PvP.
* Reputation (REP) : Players can improve standing by regularly paying daily feed fees, providing rare items, or completing mount-related quests. Higher REP may 
unlock discounts or faster mount recovery.
	* Conditional Unlocks / Favor Items : Certain special services (e.g., legendary horse care or priority access) may require a rare Favor item or high REP.
	* PvP Interaction : Stablekeepers are neutral NPCs and cannot be attacked under normal conditions; hostile enemy-faction actions are prevented.

	Mount Storage :
* Players can store up to 10 mounts with the Stablekeeper.
* Stablekeepers require "daily food" for each mount, which can be paid in advance.
	* REP Bonus : Players with higher REP may access additional slots, temporary free feed days, or reduced fees.

	Healing and Reviving :
* For a fee (in silver) and the inclusion of a specific flower, Stablekeepers can heal and revive a mount that has been injured or killed.
	* Favor Items / Conditional Unlocks : Rare items may improve healing speed or allow access to special care for legendary mounts.

	Retrieving Mounts :
* Players must physically travel to the Stablekeeper to release a mount.

		6. NPC Behavior and Interactions

	Interactions :

* Players can interact with Stablekeepers to store or retrieve mounts, heal injured horses, and manage daily care for stored mounts.
* Stablekeepers might occasionally offer favors such as healing a horse without asking for payment, reflecting their love for animals.
	* REP Mechanics : Players with higher REP may unlock additional favors, such as priority mount recovery, discounts on healing fees, or extended stabling.
	* Favor Items : Providing rare items (e.g., special flowers or feed) may temporarily unlock unique services or improve healing efficiency.

	PvP Status :

* Stablekeepers cannot be flagged for PvP, ensuring they remain neutral and protected within settlements.
	* Tier II NPC : Immune to hostile actions from players under normal circumstances; any rare enemy-faction attacks are prevented by game mechanics.

		7. NPC Relationships

* Stablekeepers typically share their living space with a "Pet Master", both residing in the same house or stable.
	* Interaction Mechanics : Despite sharing space, each NPC functions independently; players must interact with the Stablekeeper for mount-related services and 
with the Pet Master for pet-related services.
	* Conditional Unlocks : Certain mount-related perks or rare care services may require high REP with the Stablekeeper, regardless of Pet Master interaction.
	* Dynamic Environment : The shared space provides visual cues of available services (stables, hay, grooming kits), helping players locate both NPCs efficiently.
