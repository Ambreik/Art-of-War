			Stable Master

		1. Introduction & Role

	"Stable Masters" are specialized NPCs responsible exclusively for managing the ""Horse System"", acting as caretakers, trainers, and suppliers for player-owned 
horses. They represent the foundation of all horse-related mechanics — feeding, revival, leveling, and general maintenance.
	Unlike "Mount Masters" or "Pet Masters", "Stable Masters" do not handle creature storage, summoning, or adoption services. Their work focuses entirely on the 
wellbeing and progression of horses, treating them as loyal partners rather than utility companions.
	"Stable Masters" also function as vendors and quest givers, offering goods, feed, and training materials specific to the "Horse System". They play a key role in
the horse’s growth journey, enabling players to revive fallen horses, complete level-up quests, and acquire items needed for advancement to higher horse tiers 
(such as *Novice Horse*, *Armed Horse*, *Military Horse* or reaching tier *Legendary Horse*).

	They are typically found in major cities*, where they share space with "Mount Masters" and "Pet Masters". These shared areas are known as city stables or 
training yards, often managed or owned by the "Stable Master" themselves. Within these locations, they oversee the care of all equine companions, maintain order, 
and ensure horses are properly housed and fed.
	While their role is practical, "Stable Masters" are often portrayed as seasoned caretakers or veteran riders with deep affection for their animals. Their 
mannerisms and dialogue reflect discipline, warmth, and a sense of respect toward both horse and rider — establishing them as pillars of the equestrian community 
within the world.
