			Mailbox

		1. Introduction

	The Mailbox is a static interactive object found in every human settlement. It serves as the primary means for players to send and receive item- and currency-
based communications across characters, across time, and in many cases across locations. Located near the "Store Manager" NPC in each settlement, the Mailbox is 
part of the world’s logistical and player-to-player exchange system rather than a character service NPC.
	It complements other services (item storage, auctions, etc.) by enabling asynchronous exchange of items, gold, letters, and system notifications.

		2. Location & Placement

* Found in*every human settlement, adjacent to or near the "Store Manager NPC", typically in a commercial district, marketplace, or near inns.
* The Mailbox’s visual appearance varies by region, reflecting local architectural and cultural style 
(e.g., ornate wooden box in forest region, reinforced metal box in desert region).
* It is a fixed object (not an NPC with movement) and cannot be attacked or flagged for PvP.
* Interaction zone: players must stand within a small radius of the Mailbox to open the mail interface.

		3. Services & Mechanics

* Inbox / Outbox Interface : Players can open the Mailbox UI to view incoming messages, attachments (items, gold), and to compose outgoing mail.
* Cross-character / Cross-location retrieval : Items sent via mail can be retrieved from any Mailbox in any settlement (subject to rules you define).
* Item & Gold Attachments : Players may attach items (that are eligible), gold, or predefined currency items.
* Expiry / Return Mechanism : Outgoing mail remains deliverable; after a set time if unopened the mail can be returned to sender, or attachments may expire 
(depending on your rule set).
* Notifications : When a player has mail waiting, an icon appears on their minimap / UI (as in WoW mail). ([lebbyguides.com][1])
* Attachment Limits / Slots : The Mailbox interface shows a limited number of message slots per player (may increase by account unlocks or character progression).
* Cross-faction rules : (As your design may dictate) either disallow cross‐faction mail, or allow with restrictions. Since you avoid morality/faction bias, the rule
can simply be "mail allowed to characters of same faction; cross-faction only via special items/quests."
* Special Service Items : You may support items that convert a Mailbox into a portable mailbox (usable outside fixed settlement locations) for a cooldown period.

		4. UI / Player Interaction

* When a player interacts with the Mailbox, the window opens with two main tabs: "Inbox" and "Send Mail".
* Inbox lists all messages sorted by date, sender, attachments, gold, status (read/unread).
* Send Mail allows the player to choose recipient (character name/alts list), subject line, message body (optional), attach items/gold, and send.
* A minimap icon or overlay appears when new mail is received.
* Hovering over a message shows attachments and time left until expiry.
* Archive or delete functions allow players to manage mail backlog.
* If the Mailbox is full (max messages) or attachments exceed limits, a (friendly) error message asks the player to clear space.

		5. Rules & Limits

* Maximum message capacity : e.g., 100 messages visible, any beyond are still stored but not listed until some are removed. Wowpedia][2])
* Expiry time : Messages may expire after a defined number of days (e.g., 30 days) and may be returned to sender or destroyed.
* Attachment eligibility : Only non-soulbound items may be mailed; certain rare items require special unlock.
* Gold/Item limits : There may be caps per message (to avoid exploits).
* Cross-character vs account-wide : Specify whether mail is cross-character within account or restricted per character.
* Player safety : Mailbox cannot be attacked or used in PvP; cannot be targeted by hostile players.

		6. Flavor & Region Adaptation

* Each Mailbox design reflects regional aesthetics: forest settlements may have wooden crates with vine carvings; desert towns may have sealed brass boxes; 
icy regions may have frost-covered iron vaults.
* Sound/visual effect: opening the Mailbox may produce a “letter flap” sound and a soft glow when new mail arrives.
* Access animation: character reaches into the mail slot, brief delay to open UI.

		7. Additional Features / Considerations

* Portable Mailbox Item : Create a rare item that allows a player to access their mailbox from the field (e.g., “Traveler’s Letter Satchel”). Cooldown 1-2 hours.
* Guild Mailbox Variant : Consider a separate variant for guild-level mail (if you have guild system), enabling guild announcements, guild bank attachments.
* Spam/Abuse Control : Implement filtering or limits to prevent mail flooding, item send spam, or exploit of the system.
* Link with Auction/Storage Systems : Mailbox can automatically receive items/gold from successful auctions or storage retrievals.
* Notifications Outside Settlement : If player is away from settlement they receive minimap icon or sound to indicate mail waiting, encouraging return.
