			Teleporter NPC class
			

		1. Introduction & Purpose

	"Teleporter NPCs" are specialized entities responsible for facilitating instant travel between key world locations, serving as the backbone of the player 
fast-travel network.
	They allow players to move between regions, cities, special hubs, or realms efficiently, often at a cost of in-game currency or special items.
	Each "Teleporter" is unique and location-bound, with specific destinations and lore relevance tied to the area they serve. Some maintain fixed posts within 
settlements or capitals, while others wander within designated zones to provide temporary travel opportunities.
	They are neutral NPCs, unaligned with any player faction, and generally non-hostile unless provoked in PvP situations. Depending on the type, some may even 
exist outside the mortal realm (such as Spirit Healers).

	Distinct types include:

* Bazaar Teleporters — Connect players between settlements and the central Bazaar hub.
* Regional Teleporters — Enable fast travel between major regions within a continent (e.g., Dendera or Zonen).
* Underworld Teleporters (Spirit Healers) — Govern teleportation within the Underworld Realm and provide return travel to the living world.
* Outland Teleporters — Located in the main cities of Outland Territories, connecting all regional hubs for easier navigation.

	Their primary goal is to save travel time, enhance exploration flow, and support trade and quest accessibility across continents and realms.

		2. Core Functions & Mechanics

	"Teleporter NPCs" provide a structured yet flexible method of instant travel between predetermined destinations. Each teleporter has its own operational rules, 
cost structure, and area of influence.

	Primary Mechanics :

* Teleportation Between Fixed Points :
	Each teleporter links to a defined network of destinations (regional hubs, capital cities, or special zones). Players can only select from the teleporter’s 
specific list of connected points.

* Payment System :
	Teleportation requires a fee, which varies depending on the teleporter type and destination distance:
		*Standard Teleporters* — require silver or gold.
		*Regional Teleporters (Telara Windstrider & Eryndra Shadewind) — may accept regional currencies).
		*Spirit Healers* — charge symbolic costs such as reduced item durability or limited daily uses.

* Faction Neutrality :
	Teleporters serve all factions equally. They remain neutral and non-hostile unless a player initiates PvP combat directly against them.

* Conditions for Use :
	* Players must meet minimum level requirements for long-distance or inter-regional travel.
	* No reputation requirement is needed unless specified by special teleporters.
	* Some teleporters (like Spirit Healers) may only be usable under certain world-state conditions — e.g., player death or Underworld access.

* Cooldown Rules :
	Most teleportations have no cooldown, though limited-use teleporters (Spirit Healers or temporary field teleporters) may apply restrictions.

* Special Teleport Effects :
	* Each teleport has a unique animation or particle effect (based on region or NPC type).
	* Some teleporters briefly phase players through a visual portal realm during transfer, enhancing immersion.
	* Errors or interference (e.g., PvP zones, war events) can temporarily disable teleport access in affected areas.

	These mechanics ensure that teleportation remains a valuable convenience system — fast, consistent, and balanced by contextual costs and availability.

		3. Types of Teleporters

	Each Teleporter NPC type serves a distinct travel function within the world, based on region, realm, or purpose. While they share core teleportation mechanics, 
each subtype operates under unique contextual rules, costs, and visual identity.

		4. Location & Distribution Rules**

* General Placement :
	"Teleporter NPCs" are positioned strategically across the world to facilitate travel between major regions, cross-realm access, and specialized hubs such as the
"Bazaar" or the "Underworld Realm".

* Fixed vs Roaming :
	* Most Teleporters are fixed to key settlements, capitals, and travel hubs.
	* A few (such as wandering Bazaar assistants or regional emissaries) may roam within human settlements, offering temporary access or appearing near player 
gathering points.

* Specific Locations :
	* "Serena Duskweaver" — present in all major human settlements and within the Bazaar itself.
	* "Spirit Healer" — exclusively located within the "Underworld Realm", appearing at Spirit Healer shrines or cross-realm anchor points.
	* "Telara Windstrider" — found in "Fanthe’kar" and "Garland" of "Dendera Continent", near major settlements or regional borders.
	* "Eryndra Shadewind" — found in "Askania" and "WasteLands" of "Zonen Continent", near corresponding travel hubs and capital routes.
	* "Outland Regional Teleporters" — stationed in each of the four "Outland Territories"’ main cities, providing inter-regional travel and fast relocation between
frontier hubs.

* Environmental Integration :
	Teleporters are often positioned near "Guardians" sharing proximity to reinforce settlement structure.
	Their visual markers (arcane glyphs, light pillars, or sigil stones) denote teleport zones clearly to players.

* Access Control :
	* All Teleporters are neutral to faction alignment unless directly attacked.
	* Certain teleportation points (like the Underworld or special Outland hubs) may require specific currencies or level thresholds to access.

		5. NPC Behavior & Combat Rules

* General Behavior :
	"Teleporter NPCs" maintain a neutral stance toward all players, regardless of faction or reputation. They do not engage in combat unless directly attacked or 
drawn into PvP conflict.

* Combat Rules :
	* Skillable NPCs : Teleporters can be targeted and damaged if a player or monster initiates combat, particularly in PvP-enabled zones or outlaw attacks.
	* No Aggro Response : They do not retaliate; upon taking fatal damage, they temporarily vanish and respawn after a short timer at their original location.
	* PvP Impact : Defeating a Teleporter grants minor PvP points, but does not affect the teleportation network or cause world instability.
	* Invulnerability Exceptions : Some (like "Spirit Healers") are immune to attacks due to their sacred or non-physical nature within the "Underworld Realm".

* Idle Animations :
	* "Serena Duskweaver" : Performs fluid hand gestures over a glowing sigil or floating orb, occasionally whispering arcane phrases.
	* "Telara Windstrider" & "Eryndra Shadewind" : Hold a staff or rune-stone; occasional wind or energy effects swirl around them.
	* "Spirit Healer" : Constantly levitates slightly above the ground, emitting faint spectral light.
	* "Outland Teleporters" : Maintain a focused stance with their hands over an activated portal rune.

* Wandering Patterns :
	* Most Teleporters are stationary, especially those tied to regional or fixed travel nodes.
	* Some roaming "Bazaar" or settlement Teleporters wander predefined routes within their town, pausing at plazas, markets, or entrances to assist travelers.
	* When moving, they emit faint magical particles or shimmering trails to signal their presence to nearby players.

		6. Special Restrictions & Edge Cases

* Level Requirements :
	* Certain regional teleporters, such as "Telara Windstrider" and "Eryndra Shadewind", require the player to meet minimum level thresholds before allowing 
teleportation between regions (to prevent early progression skips).

* Underworld Teleportation Penalty :
	* Using the "Spirit Healer" to return from the "Underworld Realm" may result in temporary debuffs, such as reduced item durability or weakened stats for a short
duration.
	* The "Spirit Healer" can only teleport players to previously visited "Spirit Healer" nodes or their last death-linked location.

* Destination Cooldowns :
	* While teleportation is instant, traveling between major continents (e.g., Dendera ↔ Zonen ↔ Outland Territories) enforces a global cooldown of 10 minutes 
before another teleport can occur.
	* Intra-region teleporters (within the same continent) have no cooldown, allowing for fluid movement.

* Payment & Access Restrictions :
	* Each "Teleporter" requires a specific currency or resource (e.g., "Silver", or regional currency) unique to their region.
	* "Bazaar Teleports" are free of charge when leaving the "Bazaar", but cost a small fee when entering from an external location.
	* Some teleporters may refuse service to outlaws, players flagged in combat, or those with active bounty status.

* Item & Token Limitations :
	* Certain teleporters require "Teleport Tokens" or "Runic Stones" — consumable items that can be crafted or purchased from profession NPCs.
	* Players can store up to three active teleport destinations in their teleportation log; additional slots may unlock through achievements or quests.

* Environmental & Event Exceptions :
	* During world events or sieges, regional teleporters may temporarily deactivate to prevent instant travel into conflict zones.
	* In rare magical anomalies, teleportation might redirect players to a safe fallback hub (nearest capital) rather than the intended destination.
