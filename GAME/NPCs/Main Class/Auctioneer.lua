			Auctioneer

	An "Auctioneer" is a specialized NPC who facilitates player-to-player transactions by allowing characters to create, list, and bid on auctions within the game. 
Auctioneers provide a marketplace where players can trade goods, with the NPC serving as the intermediary for managing bids and transactions.

	Locations : 
- Found in major cities and "Bazzar" across the game world.
- Auctioneers are typically located in dedicated buildings, which are often well-guarded by "Guardians".

	Appearance : 
- Auctioneers are typically well-dressed, reflecting their role as prominent figures in the marketplace.
- They are often surrounded by a stack of gold coins, marking their presence for easy identification, especially on the minimap when using the tracking system.

	Functions : 

1. "Auction System" : 
   - Auctioneers allow players to create auctions by listing their items for sale to the general public.
   - Players can bid on items posted by others, creating a dynamic trading environment.
   - The auction system provides a virtual marketplace where players can buy, sell, and trade items without direct interaction.
   - Auctioneers handle all bidding and transaction logistics, ensuring that successful bids are processed and items are transferred to the winning bidder.

2. "Auction Fees" : 
   - Players are required to pay a fee to use the auction service. This fee is typically paid when the player first lists an item for auction.
   - A small secondary fee is charged to the seller once the item is sold, ensuring the Auctioneer is compensated for their services.
   - The auction interface is automatically displayed upon interacting with the Auctioneer, making the process seamless for players.

3. "Virtual Market and Automatic Messages" : 
   - The Auctioneer generates automatic messages that inform item owners about the status of their auction and provide alerts when their items are bid on or sold.
   - Common auctioneer messages:
     - "Please feel free to browse the items up for bid, or to list an item, I can help with pleasure."
     - "Money means success, we can be full of it together."
   - These messages are part of the system that ensures the auction process is transparent and players are always kept informed.
