			Mount Master

		1. Introduction

	> The Mount Master is an NPC who specializes in the care and maintenance of mounts, such as horses and other rideable animals. Unlike Pet Masters, who manage 
pets, the Mount Master focuses solely on mounts. They offer services such as mount storage, revival, and the sale of items related to mounts, including food, 
ability enhancements, and skill scrolls.

---

		Expanded Description

	Mount Masters are highly respected figures across all known regions, serving as both guardians and caretakers of the noble beasts that carry adventurers through
their journeys. Their bond with mounts is more than professional — it is deeply spiritual. Each Mount Master believes that every creature entrusted to their care 
carries a soul bound to its rider, and they see it as their sacred duty to maintain that bond through nurture, healing, and discipline.

	Factional Identity

* Dendera Mount Masters are known for their gentle and ceremonial approach to animal care. They consider mounts to be divine companions, symbols of loyalty and 
strength. Their stables are well-kept, adorned with banners, polished wood, and brass fittings — reflecting their devotion and discipline.
	* Their Mount Masters often wear clean riding uniforms with crest-embroidered cloaks.
	* Their speech is formal and courteous, reflecting a sense of nobility and reverence toward mounts.

* Zonen Mount Masters, on the other hand, are practical and rugged. They grew up taming wild creatures of the harsh lands, valuing endurance and instinct above 
refinement. Their stables are built for function — rough timber, weathered leather harnesses, and the scent of rain-soaked straw.
	* Their Mount Masters often wear heavy dust coats, leather gloves, and bandanas.
	* Their tone is pragmatic but kind, with a deep respect for the hardships of both rider and beast.

	Despite their differences, all Mount Masters share a common creed:
"A rider’s worth is measured by how they treat their steed."

		Emotional Behavior and Player Interaction

	Mount Masters are emotionally reactive NPCs, capable of displaying various behaviors depending on the player’s actions around them:

* If the player assists a Mount Master (e.g., fends off attacking beasts near their stable), the NPC may respond with gratitude — bowing slightly, smiling, or 
offering small discounts.
* If the player mistreats animals (or attempts to harm mounts near the stable), the Mount Master may scold them, refuse services, or display anger animations.
* Players who bond closely with their mounts or frequently visit for feeding and maintenance may unlock special dialogue expressing admiration or respect.

		Cultural and Environmental Role

	Mount Masters serve as the cultural bridge between civilization and nature. In every town or settlement, they are seen as keepers of equilibrium — ensuring that
the beasts used for war, trade, or exploration are never exploited beyond their limits.
	They often live near "Pet Masters", "Horse Masters", or "Stablekeepers", sharing the same grounds but maintaining separate responsibilities:

*" Horse Masters" manage common horses used for local transport.
* "Mount Masters" handle advanced, rare, or exotic mounts.
* "Pet Masters" focus on domestic or battle pets.
	Together, they represent the cornerstone of every settlement’s animal network.

		Lore Significance

	In the greater world narrative, Mount Masters preserve ancient knowledge passed down through generations of beast handlers. Many trace their origins back to the
"First Riders’ Order", an ancient guild that vanished centuries ago after domesticating the first divine mount species. Some modern Mount Masters still wear fragments of armor or jewelry symbolizing this ancient bond — tokens they refuse to sell or part with.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		2. Mount Master Roles

	The Mount Master fulfills multiple interconnected roles within the world, serving as the ultimate expert in the care, training, and restoration of mounts. 
	Beyond their practical functions, they are custodians of tradition, animal welfare, and travel lore, each embodying centuries of knowledge about the noble 
creatures that serve mankind and other races.

	Mount Caretaker

	The Mount Master oversees the health and well-being of mounts, ensuring that they are stored properly and cared for at all times. They provide shelter, 
nourishment, and companionship for these creatures, maintaining the bond between rider and steed.
	Every stable under their supervision is meticulously organized — feed bins filled with enchanted grains, watering troughs cleansed by blessing stones, and 
herbal mixtures tailored to each mount’s species or temperament.

	In "Dendera", Mount Masters begin their day with small rituals, gently touching each creature’s forehead while murmuring ancient blessings for strength and 
endurance.
	In "Zonen", they emphasize discipline and physical conditioning, often leading mounts through early-morning endurance runs across sandy terrain.
	Players visiting a Mount Master may witness these moments of care or hear short tales about their mounts’ history, as every mount is seen as a companion rather 
than a tool.

		Mount Revivalist

	In the event that a mount — be it a horse, beast, or exotic creature — is injured or dies, the Mount Master can revive it for a fee, allowing players to 
continue using their mounts in the game world.
	The process of revival is more than a service — it is a sacred ritual. Mount Masters are trained in the ancient art of reawakening a mount’s life essence using 
rare materials such as "Phoenix Bloom petals", "Spirit Water", or "Soul Dust".
	Each revival is performed with quiet reverence, and players often see the Mount Master kneel beside the lifeless mount, whispering chants of restoration before 
its eyes reopen with renewed vigor.

		Mount Storage Provider

	Players can store their mounts with the Mount Master for safekeeping. This service ensures that mounts are well-fed, groomed, and protected while their owner is
away.
	A small daily fee is charged, which covers food, grooming, and magical warding to ensure the creature’s safety. Players may even prepay food costs to ensure 
their mount is cared for long-term.
	The Mount Master treats these stored creatures as honored guests — each has its own stall, nameplate, and favorite type of feed. Neglecting payment or retrieval
may lead to the Mount Master withholding the mount until dues are cleared.

		Vendor NPC

	Mount Masters sell a wide selection of goods related to mount care and performance. These include food (such as enchanted grains and healing herbs), equipment 
(saddles, bridles, and reins), and magical items that enhance mount abilities.
	They also offer mount-specific ability scrolls that can improve traits like stamina, agility, or sprint duration.
	The Mount Master’s shop interface is organized with precision — food items, enhancement scrolls, revival reagents, and mount gear are neatly categorized, 
ensuring travelers can quickly find what they need before venturing out again.

		Quest Giver

	Some Mount Masters offer specialized quests related to mount training, breeding, or finding rare materials that benefit mounts. These tasks might involve curing
an ailing steed, retrieving herbs for improved vitality, or rescuing wild mounts from dangerous terrain.
	Such quests deepen the bond between the player and their mount, often unlocking minor permanent boosts or unique emotes showing affection between rider and 
creature.
	Through these tasks, players also learn fragments of the "Lore of the Reins" — an oral tradition passed down through Mount Masters across generations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		3. Mount Master Services

	Mount Masters provide a wide range of essential services to players, ensuring that every mount — from common horses to rare magical beasts — receives proper 
care, enhancement, and restoration. Each service is rooted in ancient stable traditions and reinforced through practical expertise, ensuring that both new and 
veteran riders benefit from the Mount Master’s knowledge and craftsmanship.

---

	Mount Revival

	Mount Masters can revive mounts that have died, although this applies only to "normal horses" and "rideable mounts", not spiritual or undead creatures. The 
revival process requires both a fee and a "unique ritual item" — often a rare component such as a "Lifebloom Flower", "Starlit Feather", or "Soulroot Herb", 
depending on the mount’s origin and type.
	The ritual itself is a solemn event. The "Mount Master" kneels beside the fallen mount, placing their palm over its heart and whispering ancestral words of 
renewal. A faint light surrounds the creature as vitality returns to its body, followed by a brief animation or sound cue signifying successful revival.
	This service reinforces the player’s bond with their companion and serves as a critical mechanic for preserving mounts during high-risk exploration or combat-
heavy adventures. The revival cost scales with the mount’s rarity or level, ensuring balance and realism in the system.

---

	Mount Storage

	Players can store their mounts with the Mount Master for safekeeping while they explore, travel, or undertake missions where mounts are not permitted. 
	The Mount Master charges a daily storage fee, which covers stable maintenance, magical warding, and food.
	Players are required to supply food for their stored mounts, though the "Mount Master" allows prepaid feeding plans, enabling long-term storage without daily 
visits.
	If the player neglects payment, the mount remains locked in its stall until the debt is cleared — a subtle reminder of the "Mount Master"’s professionalism and 
the world’s economy-based realism. This service is particularly useful for players who own multiple mounts or need to rotate between them for terrain-specific 
travel.

---

	Mount Ability and Skill Enhancements

	Mount Masters offer special items that grant or enhance mount abilities, unlocking potential beyond basic riding functions. These may include:

* Speed Enhancers : Potions or charms that increase sprint speed for a limited duration.
* Endurance Charms : Items improving a mount’s stamina, reducing fatigue on long journeys.
* Affinity Scrolls : Teach mounts new behaviors, such as evasion maneuvers, combat assists, or increased loyalty.

	Players can purchase these items or, in some cases, earn them through mount-related quests. Advanced "Mount Masters" in capital cities may even perform direct 
mount training sessions, where players watch their companion practice new skills in real time through short animations.
	This mechanic adds depth to mount progression — encouraging players to invest in and bond with their mounts as evolving partners rather than simple means of 
transport.

---

	Mount Food and Items

	"Mount Masters" maintain a wide selection of mount-related goods, ensuring all riders have access to necessary care supplies and performance upgrades. The 
vendor catalog typically includes:

* Mount Food : Grains, fruits, and herbal blends that maintain health, increase loyalty, or temporarily boost stamina.
* Special Feed : Enchanted mixtures (e.g., "Silvergrain Mix" or "Moonroot Blend") that restore health faster or strengthen specific traits.
* Equipment : Saddles, reins, horseshoes, and armor crafted from premium materials that affect mount attributes like speed, durability, or control.
* Training Tools : Whistles, grooming kits, and charm stones used for bonding, training, or affection-based activities.

---

	Player Progression Impact

	"Mount Masters" evolve alongside the player’s journey, unlocking progression-based services as riders gain experience and mastery with their mounts. The more a 
player interacts with their mount — through travel distance, participation in mounted combat, or completion of mount-related quests — the more the "Mount Master" 
recognizes their bond and trust.

	At certain progression milestones, players unlock new benefits:

* Rank I – Novice Rider : Access to standard mount storage and revival.
* Rank II – Trained Rider : Unlocks access to enhanced feed types and minor skill scrolls.
* Rank III – Skilled Rider : Enables purchase of advanced gear (e.g., speed saddles, armored tack).
* Rank IV – Master Rider : Grants the ability to train mounts for combat-related skills or environmental adaptations (e.g., snow traversal, desert endurance).
* Rank V – Legendary Rider : The Mount Master offers unique quests to obtain rare or ancient mounts, as well as exclusive care rituals unavailable elsewhere.

	This system integrates the "Mount Master" into the player’s overall progression, making them more than just a service provider — they become a trusted partner 
in the player’s growth, reflecting both achievement and dedication.

		4. NPC Characteristics and Appearance

	"Mount Masters" are among the most respected and serene figures in the world’s settlements — caretakers of noble creatures and custodians of the ancient bond 
between rider and mount. They embody patience, wisdom, and discipline, values reflected not only in their mannerisms but in their entire way of life. Each 
"Mount Master", regardless of region or allegiance, shares a quiet reverence for the creatures they tend — be they humble workhorses or rare, magical beasts.

---

	Appearance

	"Mount Masters" are generally depicted as experienced individuals, their age and demeanor reflecting years of close companionship with animals. Many are older 
men and women, though some regions feature younger or middle-aged handlers trained by veteran masters. Their attire varies by faction and climate but always 
maintains an air of practicality and refinement.

* "Dendera Mount Masters" often wear earth-toned robes or reinforced leather attire, reflecting their connection to fertile lands and traditional craftsmanship.
Their garments are adorned with silver clasps or crests symbolizing mastery over creatures of burden and travel.
* "Zonen Mount Masters", by contrast, prefer light desert garments and veils, dyed in sandy hues to withstand heat and wind. They commonly decorate their belts or 
saddlebags with feathers, bones, or carved runes, honoring their mounts’ endurance through harsh terrains.
* In the "Outland Territories", "Mount Masters" often wear a mixture of foreign and local materials — armor plating, fur linings, or enchanted fabrics — marking 
their adaptability and experience across varied climates and hostile lands.

	Their physical presence conveys strength balanced by empathy. Many carry grooming tools, saddle repair kits, or pouches of feed rather than weapons. Some wield 
a staff or short blade not for battle, but as a tool of guidance or defense against wild predators.
	Facial expressions are calm and deliberate. A "Mount Master"’s gaze is observant — always assessing a mount’s posture, breathing, or gait — and their movements 
slow, measured, and reassuring to both player and beast. Despite their calm exterior, these NPCs are deeply aware of their surroundings, often reacting with soft-
spoken concern or visible irritation when a player mistreats a mount nearby.

---

	Personality and Behavior

	"Mount Masters" share a humble, grounded temperament, speaking in measured tones and valuing respect above all else. They take pride in teaching proper mount 
care, often offering gentle lessons or short lines of dialogue about discipline, loyalty, and patience.
	Many are emotionally expressive in subtle ways — offering nods of approval when players care for their mounts properly, or showing brief disappointment when 
neglect occurs.

	Some regional variants display distinct traits:

* "Dendera Masters" tend to be warm and instructive, treating players as apprentices and occasionally sharing old legends of ancient steeds or sacred herds.
* "Zonen Masters" are pragmatic and cautious, focusing on survival and endurance rather than sentimentality.
* "Outland Masters" are stoic wanderers, often exiled handlers or veteran riders who found peace in solitude, far from human cities.

	All Mount Masters share a protective instinct toward animals — in scripted interactions, they might approach injured or tired mounts, kneel beside them, or 
perform idle animations of brushing or feeding.

---

	Non-PvP Status

	"Mount Masters" are non-hostile NPCs and cannot be flagged for PvP combat. Their sanctuaries — stables, training grounds, or wilderness shelters — are 
designated "safe zones", protected from skirmishes or raids.
	Even in conflict-heavy areas, opposing players are discouraged (by both lore and system) from attacking them, as they are seen as neutral caretakers of life, 
respected by all civilized factions.
	Some rare "Mount Masters", particularly those in remote or contested areas, are guarded by mount companions or stable animals that react defensively if their 
master is threatened. However, such aggression is purely protective and not PvP-related.

---

	Location and Environmental Integration

	"Mount Masters" are typically found in stables, inns, or open ranches, often alongside "Stablekeepers" or "Pet Masters". Their environments are purposefully 
designed to evoke tranquility and care — sounds of gentle wind, neighing, and soft torchlight accompany their presence.
	Each Mount Master’s home or stall reflects the regional ecosystem and cultural influences :

* Dendera’s green valleys house wooden stables adorned with hanging herbs.
* Zonen’s desert shelters are built from sandstone and shaded by cloth banners.
* Outland stables mix various architectures — reinforced wooden fences, glowing runic totems, or open courtyards where exotic mounts roam freely.

	In the wilderness, "Mount Masters" may be found living alone near hidden paths or ruins, offering rare services to travelers who manage to find them. These 
secluded "NPCs" are often skilled in handling extraordinary mounts — giant beasts, hybrids, or semi-mystical creatures — and their dialogue reveals knowledge about 
regions or creatures unseen elsewhere.

---

	Emotional and Interactive Behavior

	Each "Mount Master" has emotion-based interaction triggers reflecting their awareness and empathy.

* If a player assists in defending a stable from a threat, the "Mount Master" may express gratitude through dialogue or animation, such as a bow, salute, or a 
thankful pat on the player’s mount.
* Neglectful or aggressive player actions near animals might prompt subtle reproachful comments or disapproving gestures.
* Players with strong bonds to their mounts (measured by care frequency or time spent together) might receive ** responses, like the Master quietly remarking on 
their shared strength or dedication.

	These emotional systems make "Mount Masters" feel alive and reactive — not mere merchants, but guardians of an ancient tradition where rider and mount share 
equal respect and trust.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		5. Special NPC Behaviors

	"Mount Masters" are living symbols of patience, respect, and discipline — traits that are mirrored in their every gesture and line of dialogue. Their behaviors 
are not static; rather, they evolve based on player interaction, environment, and the overall health of nearby mounts. They are built to feel alive, genuine, and 
emotionally aware of the creatures they protect.

---

	Friendly Interaction

	"Mount Masters" are deeply empathetic NPCs, defined by their love for animals and their quiet admiration for those who treat mounts with care. They often engage
players with warm dialogue lines, contextual advice, or observational comments about the player’s mount condition, performance, or bond strength.

	These interactions are dynamic — drawn from a small emotional library of responses that reflect the situation around them:

* When a player approaches with a healthy mount, the Master may say:
	"Your companion walks proud — a reflection of your care."

* If the player’s mount appears weary or neglected:
	"Every stride tells a story. This one carries a heavy burden… Feed it well, traveler."

* Upon a mount’s revival:
	"Even the strongest fall — but every loyal heart deserves another chance."

	This warmth extends into the animation system. "Mount Masters" often pause during idle cycles to brush a nearby mount, fill a trough with water, or softly 
whistle to calm restless animals. These gestures are tied to player proximity and mount state — adding immersive realism to their daily routines.

	While they remain polite in most circumstances, "Mount Masters" can display emotional reactions:

* Gratitude : When a player helps defend a stable or assists nearby animals.
* Disapproval : If a player shows cruelty or neglect (e.g., leaving a mount to die in combat too often).
* Admiration : When interacting with players who own rare mounts or exhibit strong mount bonds (tracked through hidden affinity metrics).

	In some cases, repeated kind actions may even unlock unique interactions or minor discounts, symbolizing a personal bond between the player and the 
"Mount Master".

---

	Mount Storage Fees and Responsibility System

	"Mount Masters" uphold a strict sense of responsibility — not just for animals, but for those who claim to care for them. When a mount is stored, the Master 
requires the player to provide daily food fees, representing upkeep and nourishment for the creature while in care.

	This system introduces a mild simulation of accountability :

* If the player fails to pay the daily fee, the Mount Master withholds the mount until the debt is cleared.
* The owed amount increases slightly over time, simulating the additional care required during unpaid days.
* Alternatively, the Mount Master may accept goods or crafted food instead of currency, encouraging trade and profession use.

	While firm in policy, the Mount Master’s tone remains calm and instructive — not punitive. Their dialogue emphasizes moral care:

> "A mount’s hunger does not wait, traveler. Their trust, once broken, takes long to mend."

	Upon settling debts or repaying overdue care fees, the Master may respond with mild approval:

> "Your responsibility restores balance. Your companion awaits you, well-fed and patient."

	These mechanics strengthen immersion by merging roleplay with moral consequence — rewarding consistent, attentive players while softly reprimanding neglectful 
ones.

---

	Environmental and Emotional Reactions

	"Mount Masters" react subtly to world events around them. If nearby animals are harmed or loud combat occurs near the stable, they might:

* Walk toward the noise to observe.
* Shout for calm or order.
* Perform protective gestures toward frightened mounts.

	During storms or heavy weather, they might retreat inside the stable, light a lantern, or close the doors — small atmospheric details showing their active role 
in the world rather than static presence.

	In player-heavy areas, they may perform periodic animations of feeding or stroking mounts — ambient world-building that reinforces their nature as caretakers.

---

	Favored Players and Unique Bonds

	"Mount Masters" remember repeat visitors. Players who frequently store or revive their mounts with the same Master will eventually develop a "Trust Bond" — a 
small, cosmetic or dialogue-based recognition of respect.

* These players may receive exclusive greetings, discounted revival fees, or small lore insights into regional mounts and their origins.
* Some high-trust "Mount Masters"
 might reveal hidden quests or personal requests, such as retrieving lost reins, rescuing an abandoned foal, or helping rebuild part of the stable.

	The higher the player’s bond, the more emotive and personalized the Master’s responses become. This gives the impression of a genuine friendship forged through 
shared respect for life.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		6. NPC Vendor Window Structure

	The "Mount Master’s Vendor Window" is one of the most detailed NPC interfaces in the game, combining traditional merchant functionality with specialized mount 
management systems. It not only acts as a point of commerce but also as a mount management hub, allowing players to care for, improve, and interact with their 
mounts in a tangible and meaningful way.

	This interface is divided into multiple tabs, each serving a distinct purpose tied to the Mount Master’s expertise and the player's mount-related progression.

---

	I. Mount-Related Goods

	Within the primary merchant tab, players can browse, purchase, and manage items tied to mount care, customization, and revival. The inventory is dynamic — 
expanding as the player’s mount rank, profession level, or Mount Master trust level increases.

	Available Categories

* "Mount Food"
	Essential consumables that sustain and strengthen mounts. Food quality and effects vary by rarity and origin.
	Examples include:
	* Field Grain Feed – Restores basic stamina and hunger.
	* Refined Herb Mix – Enhances recovery and resistance to fatigue.
	* Golden Oats of Rydia – A premium food granting temporary movement and endurance bonuses.
	* Frostleaf Blend – A special cold-resistant feed, effective for mounts in frozen regions.
    These foods can be purchased individually or in bulk, with certain Mount Masters offering regional specialties (e.g., jungle herbs, tundra grains).

* "Mount Enhancements"
	Consumable or equippable items that improve a mount’s combat or traversal abilities.
	Examples include:
	* Saddle of Endurance – Increases mounted travel time before rest is required.
	* Rein of Windstride – Adds a small burst-speed ability (usable every 2 minutes).
	* Ironhoof Shoeing Kit – Enhances mount stability and knockback resistance.
	* Skill Scrolls of Bonding – Unlocks mount-specific abilities such as charge attacks, dodging, or extended carrying capacity.
   
   These enhancements may be temporary, permanent, or limited by mount rank.

* "Revival Items"
	Essential materials used during the revival process. While revival itself requires Mount Master interaction, players can stock these items for emergencies 
or as payment-in-kind.
	Examples include:
	* Spiritbloom Flower – A rare herb used to restore vitality to fallen mounts.
	* Essence of Renewal Flask – Used in advanced mount resurrection rituals.
	* Phoenix Dust – A legendary reagent reserved for reviving elite or mystical mounts.

---

	II. Storage and Management Interface

	Accessible through a secondary tab, the "Storage Window" serves as both a mount roster and care monitor. It’s designed with clarity and immersion in mind, 
reflecting the "Mount Master"’s meticulous record-keeping habits.

	Displayed Information

* Stored Mount List
	Displays all currently stored mounts (up to 10 by default). Each entry shows:
	* Mount name
	* Species and rank
	* Bond Level (a hidden measure of mount-player relationship)
	* Hunger and happiness status
	* Days remaining of prepaid food

* Daily Food and Care Fees
	Each mount requires a small daily upkeep fee in silver or gold, depending on species rarity.
	* The interface displays "Next Due Payment" and "Last Payment Date."
	* If the player fails to pay, the entry turns "red", and the mount cannot be retrieved until the debt is cleared.

* Prepay Option
	Players can pay food fees in advance for several days (up to 30). Some Mount Masters offer small discounts for longer prepayments.

* Retrieve / Store Buttons
	Allows quick management of mounts.
	* Store Mount : Deposits the currently summoned mount into storage.
	* Retrieve Mount : Releases a stored mount, requiring that care fees are up to date.
	* Release Mount Permanently : Removes a mount from the roster (requires confirmation).

---

	III. Mount Condition and Bond Indicators

	In the upper corner of the window, a "Mount Condition Meter" displays overall mount status — a mix of health, happiness, and hunger. Color-coded indicators help
players track well-being:

* Healthy : Fully fed and content.
* Hungry : Moderate care needed soon.
* Neglected : At risk of losing trust or health over time.

	Bond Indicators subtly reward attentive players. Mounts regularly cared for through the Mount Master interface gradually gain trust, which in turn unlocks 
bonuses like:
* Faster mounting/dismounting.
* Reduced food consumption.
* Aesthetic changes (mane shine, aura effects).

---

	IV. Visual and UI Aesthetics

	The vendor interface reflects the "Mount Master"’s environment — wooden textures, stable motifs, faint ambient sounds (snorting horses, rustling hay). Each 
regional "Mount Master" has a thematic variant :
* Desert settlements : Leather and rope designs, warm tones.
* Frozen territories : Frosted glass UI with pale lighting.
* Jungle regions : Wooden frame with green vines and tribal etching.

	"Mount Masters" occasionally appear in the background of the vendor window — brushing a horse or sorting saddle gear — reinforcing immersion and NPC presence.

---

	V. Integrated Lore and Utility

	The "Mount Master"’s vendor system isn’t just a menu — it’s a living extension of the world’s ecology. The available goods and services evolve as new mounts, 
regions, and biomes are discovered.
	As players progress, rare "Mount Masters" may unlock unique regional goods, tying their inventory to the environment’s lore — for example, selling "Ashen Horn Powder" in volcanic zones or "Silvergrass Feed" in plains regions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		7. Mount Master Locatio

	"Mount Masters" are strategically placed across the game world to ensure players have access to mount-related services whenever they need them. Their locations 
are tied to both functional needs (storing, reviving, and enhancing mounts) and world immersion (travel hubs, stables, and high-traffic areas).

---

	Common Locations

* Stables and Inns :
	"Mount Masters" are most frequently found near stables, inns, or large taverns that act as travel hubs. These locations allow players to easily manage their 
mounts while resting, preparing for travel, or engaging in trade.

* Near Pet Masters :
	In settlements that host pet and mount services, "Mount Masters" are typically located close to Pet Masters. This proximity reinforces the idea of animal care 
districts, where players can manage all their companions in one area.

* Travel and Fast-Access Points :
	"Mount Masters" are also positioned near key fast-travel locations, including city gates, crossroads, and caravan stations. This ensures that players can summon
or store mounts conveniently during exploration, questing, or PvP events.

* Wilderness and Secluded Outposts :
	Some "Mount Masters" operate in remote wilderness areas, offering mount services to players adventuring far from settlements. These NPCs usually have their own 
stalls, temporary encampments, or small stable structures. Their presence reinforces the realism of mount care even in untamed regions.

* Capital Cities and Major Settlements :
	In major cities, "Mount Masters" serve as centralized hubs, providing access to mount management services for high-level or mid-game players. Their stables are 
often larger and offer more specialized services, such as rare mount enhancements or revival of higher-tier mounts.

* Outland Territories :
	"Mount Masters" in "Outland Territories" are found in almost every human settlement, reflecting the increased reliance on mounts for traversing expansive or 
dangerous terrain. Some "Outland Masters" offer region-specific mounts or unique items tied to local environmental conditions.

---

	Environmental and Lore Considerations

* Regional Theming :
	Each Mount Master’s location reflects the surrounding environment:
	* Snowy regions have icy-stable structures with reinforced stalls.
	* Forested or jungle areas have wooden, vine-decorated stables.
	* Desert areas use shaded tents or adobe structures.

* NPC Interactions :
	Mount Masters may occasionally walk around their stables, groom mounts, or interact with players who are nearby. Some use animations to signal readiness for 
mount retrieval or training, reinforcing immersion.

* Accessibility :
	Most locations are designed so players can quickly locate Mount Masters, often indicated on the map or by local NPC guidance, especially in capital cities or
major regional hubs.
