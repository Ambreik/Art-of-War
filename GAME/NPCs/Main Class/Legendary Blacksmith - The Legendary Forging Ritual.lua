			The Legendary Forging Ritual: *Epic → Legendary Evolution*

		Overview

	The "Forging Ritual" is available at all "Legendary Blacksmiths" worldwide.
	Players bring their fully upgraded "Epic Equipment" (+9) and undergo a multi-step process involving gathering, crafting, and time-based forging.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		Eligible Equipment Categories

	The player can submit only one item per ritual. Each belongs to one of the three recognized forging categories:

* Armor Category :
	Includes "Armor", "Helmets", and "Shields".
	These represent the physical and defensive aspects of a warrior’s endurance.

* Weapon Category :
	Includes Swords, Axes, Spears, Bows, Daggers, Bells, and other class-specific weapons.
	Each is imbued with the soul of battle and carries the elemental resonance of its wielder.

* Accessory Category :
	Includes "Necklaces", "Earrings", "Bracelets", and "Shoes".
	Accessories bind spiritual energy to the player, enhancing attributes and aura-based effects.

		Required Materials

1. Primary Catalyst (Unique to Equipment Type)
	* Each category of equipment requires its own catalyst:
		* Armor : "Emberheart Core"
		* Weapon : "Shard of Celestite"
		* Accessory : "Twilight Sigil"
	* These rare drops originate from elite entities in certain instances in "Outland Territories".

2. Legendary Perchant (Quest Item)
	* Acquired only through the "Forging of Legend - Quest", initiated at any "Legendary Blacksmith".
	* The quest sends the player into the "Cursed Tower", a multi-floor trial culminating in a boss battle.
	* Defeating the tower’s final boss grants the "Legendary Perchant" (100% drop chance).

3. Epic Item to Be Evolved
	* Must be fully upgraded (+9).
	* Once the forging begins, the item is temporarily removed from the player’s inventory until the ritual completes.

4. Category Focus Components
	* Unique materials bound to each equipment category:
		* Armor : "Ancestral Core"
		* Weapon : "Dragonforged Ember"
		* Accessory : "Celestial Binding Gem"
	* Dropped by open-world bosses across the "Outland Territories".

5. Elemental Essences (50x each)
	* Dropped by Rank II–IV monsters in specific regions:
		* Aarong Forest : "Earth Essence"
		* Lagooma Jungle : "Wind Essence"
		* Tenebress Territory : "Fire Essence"
		* Frozen Territory : "Ice Essence"
		* Underworld : "Shadow Essence"
		
			*(Light Essence is a crafted material and not dropped by any monster.)* --- this essence is not required for crafting "Legendary Items".

6. Refined Minerals and Ores
   * Forging requires advanced metals and stones:
		* 20x "Black Iron Bar"
		* 15x "Obsidian"
		* 10x "Shadowstone"
	* Obtained via mining professions or regional trading.

	Forging Process

* Once all materials are submitted, the "Legendary Blacksmith" begins the "Ritual of Ascension" — a two-hour forging sequence.
* The item is temporarily removed from the player’s inventory, safely stored in the blacksmith’s forge memory until the process concludes.
* The ritual has a 2-hour duration, representing both spiritual tempering and physical reforging.

* Upon starting the process, a "Forge Progress UI" appears in the player’s buff/debuff bar at the top of the screen.
* The icon displays an animated forge emblem surrounded by flames, showing the active ritual.
* Hovering the cursor over this icon reveals the tooltip:
	"Forging in Progress — Time Remaining: [hh:mm:ss]"
* The timer counts down in real-time until completion.
* The "Legendary Blacksmith" occasionally sends messages through the system feed, such as:
	"The anvil hums with life…"
	"I can feel the soul of your weapon resisting!"
	"Patience, hero. True power cannot be rushed."

* The forging process is bound to the specific "Legendary Blacksmith" who initiated it.
* Players must return to the same NPC to complete or claim the result of the ritual.
* Attempting to interact with a different "Legendary Blacksmith" during an ongoing ritual will result in the message:
	*"This forge is not bound to your creation. Seek the smith who began your legend."

	Outcome

* Success :
	* The Epic item is transformed into a "Legendary Item", gaining enhanced stats, a unique aura, and dynamic scaling with player level.
	* The item receives a new tooltip signature line: "Forged by the hand of a Legend."

* Failure :
	* The forging process fails harmlessly.
	* The item is safely returned without stat loss or destruction.
	* A temporary debuff is applied, preventing another attempt for 12 hours.
	* Debuff Name : "Temper of the Unforged"
		* Tooltip: "Still recovering from the strain of divine heat. Cannot be reforged for 12 hours."
