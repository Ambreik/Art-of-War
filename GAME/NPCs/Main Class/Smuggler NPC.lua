			Smuggler NPC

		1. Introduction**

	The "Smuggler" is a discreet yet influential NPC type that operates across ports, trade districts, and hidden corners of major human settlements.
	Smugglers act as intermediaries between lawful trade and the underground world, connecting regular adventurers and Outlaws through illicit networks of goods, 
information, and secret routes.

	While outwardly appearing as simple merchants or sailors, Smugglers maintain deep ties to the "Black Market System" and the "Outlaw Faction", granting them a 
unique dual function:
*they serve lawful players through secret trust-based missions and act as logistical allies for Outlaws moving between territories.

	Smugglers thrive in ambiguity — their loyalty lies not with law or rebellion, but with **profit and secrecy**.

		2. Locations, Appearance & Behavior

	Typical Locations :

* Found primarily near ports, docks, warehouses, taverns, or market outskirts.
* Often operate from small stalls, hidden chambers behind warehouses, or aboard old cargo ships moored in harbors.
* Some Smugglers can be found in underground tunnels, basement taverns, or abandoned houses in larger cities.

	Environmental Design :

* Their areas feature crates, barrels, ledgers, secret compartments, and disguised trapdoors.
* Lighting is dim and atmosphere subdued — lanterns, sea mist, or faint torches are common.
* In Outlaw-controlled ports, Smugglers’ dens blend with nearby black market vendors and contraband stockpiles.

	Appearance :

* Wear weathered clothing typical of sailors or traders, often marked by hidden insignias or concealed daggers.
* Regional differences exist — desert smugglers wear light robes, jungle smugglers carry vine-wrapped satchels, while northern smugglers wear fur-lined coats.

	Behavior & Interaction :

* Initially evasive and mistrusting; they speak in coded phrases and vague terms.
* Once a player proves trustworthy through specific "Smuggler Quests", their dialogue becomes open and cooperative.
* For Outlaw players, dialogue immediately reflects shared underground ties, offering special services and unique missions.

	Example Dialogue Flow (Generic Framework) :

>	Smuggler : "You look like someone who knows when to keep quiet. What brings you here, traveler?"
>	Player Options :
> • "I’m looking for work." → Unlocks trust-based or smuggling quests.
> • "I’m here on behalf of the Outlaws." → Opens Outlaw-specific dialogue and black-market access.
> • "Just passing through." → Neutral interaction, minor gossip or hints about hidden paths.
>
>	If trust established :
> "You’ve done good work for me. Perhaps it’s time you learned about... the real trade around here."

		3. Functions & Mechanics

	1. Smuggler Trust System

* Non-Outlaw players must earn the Smuggler’s trust to access their full services.
* Trust increases through completing smuggling-related tasks such as:
	* Delivering restricted cargo between settlements.
	* Escorting outlaw messengers through patrol zones.
	* Assisting in secret trades under curfew hours.

* Higher trust ranks unlock black market privileges, hidden routes, and secret dialogue options.

	2. Outlaw Integration

* Outlaw-aligned players have immediate access to Smuggler networks.
* Smugglers serve as safe contacts for Outlaws in lawful cities, offering transport, cover, and contraband trade.
* May provide escape assistance, such as:
	* Opening hidden passages to evade guards.
	* Temporarily disabling surveillance or patrol systems.
	* Allowing refuge in smuggling dens.

	3. Black Market Access

* Smugglers are part of the "Black Market System", offering or unlocking connections to black market vendors.
* Players can:
	* Purchase restricted goods (forbidden potions, enhancement tools, illegal schematics).
	* Sell contraband or stolen items.
	* Gain clues to rare item traders or hidden black market hubs.

	4. Smuggling & Theft Quests

* Quest types include:
	* *Smuggle Cargo*: Deliver secret goods between ports undetected.
	* *Stolen Ledger*: Retrieve or steal documents from city officials.
	* *Diversion Contract*: Cause chaos to distract guards during smuggling runs.
	* *Assist Escape*: Help an outlaw or NPC escape imprisonment or transport.

	5. Secret Pathways & Hidden Rooms

* Smugglers can unlock hidden tunnels, basement routes, or secret doors leading to special areas, quest hubs, or escape points.
* These can serve both gameplay shortcuts and story-driven transitions.
* Once unlocked, these paths remain permanently accessible for that player.

	6. Player Alignment Neutrality

* Smugglers do not openly belong to any faction — they cooperate with whoever benefits them.
* However, repeated betrayal or violence against Smugglers may cause global distrust, closing access to smuggling content for that player.
* Killing a Smuggler in PvP-enabled zones temporarily flags the player with a "Smuggler’s Bounty", drawing the attention of bounty hunters or rival Outlaws.
