	8. Portable Storage Access (Portable Banks)

	Overview : "Store Managers" provide a temporary, mobile extension of their item storage system via special summonable NPC items called **Portable Banks**. These
items allow players to access their stored inventory without visiting a physical Store Manager location.

	Mechanics :

* Players use a "Portable Bank" item to summon a temporary "Store Manager" NPC in the wilderness or other locations.
* Duration: 15–20 minutes (depending on item type).
* Range: Store Manager disappears if the player moves out of a predefined radius.
* Functionality: Full access to personal item storage, including slots unlocked via "Storage Permits" (temporary expansions) or "Infinite Storage Tokens" 
(account-wide, long-term expansion).
* Fees: No additional fees beyond what was already paid for storage slots.

	Known Portable Bank Items (Examples) :

1. "Agent Krik’s Summon" – 15-minute portable access.
2. "Artisan Bart’s Summon" – 15-minute portable access.
3. "Backup Boy’s Summon" – 20-minute portable access.

	Integration Notes :
* Works seamlessly with all storage slots and expansions purchased from the main Store Manager.
* All inventory rules, including account-wide infinite storage and temporary expansions, are respected.
* Can be used in solo play, group adventures, or remote locations where a Store Manager NPC is not physically present.
