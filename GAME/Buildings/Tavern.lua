			Tavern  

	Description : A tavern is an establishment found in the wilderness, providing shelter and serving as a drop point for players who die and choose "Restart in Town"
when no nearby village or settlement exists. Taverns are neutral zones, allowing PvP to happen without restrictions. They can also become a place for NPCs to start 
brawls when intoxicated.

- Key Features :
  - Amenities : Taverns usually offer food and drink vendors, stable masters, mailboxes, trainers, and quest givers. They may also harbor outlaws with bounties placed
 on them.
  - Safety : Taverns offer a safe zone from monster attacks and provide a protection radius, preventing monsters from reaching players. Guards patrol the area to 
assist.

- Buff Mechanic :  
  - Well Rest : If a character spends more than 30 minutes in a tavern (actively drinking, researching, or engaging in activities), they receive a buff called 
"Well Rest".  
    - Effect : Increases EXP gained from combat by 0.01% for every 1 minute spent in the tavern, with a maximum of 5% EXP increase after 30 minutes.  
    - Duration : The buff lasts for 30 minutes after leaving the tavern. If logged out, the buff persists but does not accumulate additional time.  
    - No Debuff : There is no debuff associated with the Well Rest buff.

- Design Variations :  
  - Taverns vary depending on the race or culture of the region. More developed areas may have separate buildings for tavern purposes, and the atmosphere might change
with music or different layouts based on local styles.
