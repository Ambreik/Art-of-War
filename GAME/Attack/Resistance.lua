			Resistance

	"Resistance" is a combat statistic that helps mitigate incoming damage from various sources, such as magic, normal damage, and effects. It acts as a defensive 
mechanic against different monster elements in the game.

		Elements:
- "Earth Element" : Commonly found all over the "World Game" as common creatures like animals, beasts.
- "Wind Element" : Typically found in regions like the "Lagooma Jungle" or desert areas.
- "Fire Element" : Commonly associated with the "Tenebress Territory".
- "Water Element" : Found in the "Frozen Territory" (especially in Ice monsters) and underwater creatures from the "Underwater Realm".
- "Shadow Element" : Present in creatures from the "Underworld Platform" and "Unholy Temples".
- "Holy Element" : Found in creatures within the "Tower of Light".

		Resistance System:
- A character's resistance to each elemental school is visible on the character sheet.
- Players can increase their elemental resistance by equipping items that provide "Resistance bonuses" for specific elements.
- From level 70 onwards, players can further increase resistance by using the "Inner Core" once equipped.

			PvP Considerations:
- "Resistance" is particularly useful in PvP against spellcasters such as "Shamans" and "Warlocks". Shamans use "Totems" that can have different elemental effects, 
while Warlocks use "Relics" that affect elemental resistance.
  
		Effectiveness:
- The damage absorbed per point of "Resistance" decreases as the resistance value increases, similar to armor. However, ensuring a high resistance percentage can be crucial, especially in battles with large spikes in elemental damage.
- In higher-level areas, monsters tend to have higher levels and more aggressive behavior. Players must equip higher resistance levels to survive these groups.
- Resistance can be capped at 95% for specific elements, but note that this doesn't always reduce the total damage by 95%. For example, "World Bosses" (WB) or 
"Notorious Bosses" (NB) will still deal 200% damage, meaning the resistance will only reduce the damage by a percentage of this larger value.
- To achieve the maximum 95% Resistance for an element, players must equip a full set of items that are Max Upgraded, Enchanted, and Refined.
