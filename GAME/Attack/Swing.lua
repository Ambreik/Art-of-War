			Swing

	"Swing" refers to the action and animation that occurs when your character's weapon deals damage to a target (unless the target dodges). This is a fundamental 
combat mechanic that focuses on how often and when your character will land an attack.

	Swing Attacks
- "On-Swing Attacks" : These attacks require you to wait for the next swing to happen, which is in contrast to **instant attacks** that occur immediately upon 
activation.
- "Attack Speed" : The time between two swings of a single weapon is determined by the characterâ€™s **attack speed**. This speed dictates how frequently your character
can make swings and therefore land attacks.
