			Drain

	"Drain" refers to the general mechanic that encompasses various types of abilities, primarily focusing on the removal or transfer of life, mana, soul, or energy
from the target to the user. These abilities are often categorized into different types, each with a specific effect.

		Types of Drains
	1. "Mana Drains" : Abilities that remove mana from the enemy’s mana pool. These abilities usually have a secondary effect. 
	- Example: "Drain Mana" - Warlock skill that transfers mana from the enemy to refill the caster’s mana pool.

	2. "Life Drains" : Abilities that transfer life from the enemy and add it to the player’s health pool. This is a form of damage-dealing spell that also heals 
the caster.
	- Life Drain effects can be:
		- Direct Damage (Direct Heal) : Instant damage and healing.
		- Channeled : Continuous draining of life over time.
		- Damage over Time (Heal over Time) : Deals damage and heals over a duration.
	- These abilities are used by specific classes or monsters and can be affected by healing-reducing effects.
	- *Note*: Absorb effects will prevent life drains from healing the caster, though the damage still applies to the target.
	- Binary Effects : Life Drains are either fully successful or miss entirely (no partial resist).

	3. "Soul Drains" : Abilities that transfer health points (HP) from the player character to high-ranked monsters (e.g., Notorious Monsters, Special Bosses, or 
all monsters in the Underworld with Rank 3+).

	4. "Energy Drains" : Abilities that remove energy from the enemy’s energy pool and either convert it into energy for the user or transfer energy directly to the
caster.

		Life Drains

	"Life Drain" spells are a unique form of damage and healing combination, where the target is both harmed and the caster is healed simultaneously. The amount of 
healing is directly proportional to the amount of damage dealt. 

- Healing Process : 
	- Life Drains heal the caster only for the amount of health the attack causes, up to the target's health. For instance, if the life drain deals 100 damage but 
the caster only has 50 health left, the caster will be healed for 50 health.
	- These abilities do not generate threat based on the healing portion, though the damage portion generates threat as usual.

- Effect Variations : 
	- Direct Damage/Direct Heal : The healing and damage happen instantly.
	- Channeled : The drain effect is spread over time.
	- Damage Over Time (DoT)/Heal Over Time (HoT) : Continuous effects that deal damage and heal over the duration.
  
- Immunities : Certain creatures, especially constructs, may be immune to life-draining effects.
- Spell Damage : The healing aspect is affected by the amount of spell damage from the caster's abilities and relevant talents, but it does not benefit from pure 
healing bonuses.

		Mana Drains

	"Mana Drain" spells focus on removing mana from an enemy to either weaken them or grant the caster a benefit, such as replenishing their own mana pool.

- These spells are generally used for tactical advantage, and their effect varies based on the amount of mana drained.
- Restrictions : Mana Drain abilities cannot be used against certain classes, such as Ninjas or Warriors.
- Example : 
  - "Drain Mana" - A Warlock skill that removes mana from an enemy and refills the Warlock’s own mana pool.
