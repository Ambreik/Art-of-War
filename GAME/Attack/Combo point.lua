			Combo Points System (Ninja Assassin & Ninja Rogue

	Overview :  
- Combo Points are a unique resource used by "Ninja Assassins" (Knight Faction) and "Ninja Rogues" (Pindar Faction). These points are accumulated through specific 
attacks (called 'builders') and are consumed by 'finishing moves' (called 'finishers').
- Maximum Combo Points : 5  
- UI Indicator : Combo points are displayed as an orange line beneath the character’s energy or mana bar.

		How Combo Points Work :
1. Building Combo Points :  
   - Builder Attacks : Certain special attacks generate Combo Points. These are typically quick, lower-damage moves that charge up the Combo Points bar.
   - Combo Points Generation : Combo points are generated through attacking high-level monsters, Elite Monsters, Bosses, Elite Bosses, and Special Bosses. Once a monster’s passive is triggered, a "mark" is left on the target, and using a skill on that target will automatically aim at the marked monster.

2. Finishing Moves :  
   - Finishers : These are high-damage moves that consume all accumulated Combo Points. The more Combo Points consumed, the stronger the finishing move.
   - Finishing Move Damage : The damage of finishing moves increases roughly proportionally to the number of Combo Points consumed.
   - Usage Requirements : Finishing moves can only be used if there is at least one Combo Point available. Using a finishing move will consume all available Combo Points.

	Combo Points and Marks :
1. Marking Target :  
   - Combo Points are generated on "Elite Monsters", "Bosses", and "Special Bosses" or PvP. When a passive is triggered, a "mark" is left on the target. Attacks on the marked target become enchanted.
   - Marking Effect : After marking, skills are automatically targeted at the marked monster, increasing damage based on the combo points.
  
2. Blocking Auto-targeting :  
   - To prevent unintended auto-targeting, the player must perform at least one hit on the marked target before using a skill. This will block auto-targeting until the next mark is placed on the target.

	Combo Points Scaling :
1. Combo Points Buff :  
   - Skills are enchanted with an additional damage percentage based on the number of Combo Points built up.  
   - Damage Scaling : Combo Points increase damage by 5-10% per mark, stacking up to a maximum of **80% additional damage** with all 5 Combo Points.

---

	Key Considerations :
- Combo Point Generation : Combo Points are only generated from combat against high-level targets, such as Elite monsters and bosses, making them essential for tackling tougher enemies.
- Strategic Use of Combo Points : Players must strategically manage their combo points to maximize damage output in difficult encounters, especially when facing Elite Bosses or Special Bosses.

	This system would encourage tactical decision-making and reward careful management of resources, with combo points offering an extra layer of gameplay depth for
both "Ninja Assassins" and "Ninja Rogues".
