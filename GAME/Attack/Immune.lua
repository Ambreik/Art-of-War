			Immune

	Immunity is an avoidance mechanic that can be triggered by items, spells, or be inherent to certain characters, including both players and NPCs. When a player or 
NPC is immune to a spell or ability, they will not be affected by its damage or any secondary effects it might trigger. Immunity also clears all debuffs affecting the
class temporarily.
	
	Some abilities grant total immunity for a limited time in most cases, also purging most debuffs like snares, roots, and stuns. However, exceptionally potent 
abilities like "Cure" can still remove the effect if needed.

	Immunity can also affect specific mechanics, such as "root", "snare", and others. For example, if an NPC or player is immune to stun, they will show an "Immune" 
message when hit by a stun-causing ability, but the target will still take damage from the attack.

	If a player becomes immune to all abilities a mob can use, the mob will switch to the next highest target on its aggro table (unless there are no other targets in range).
