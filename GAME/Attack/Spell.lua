			Spell

	A "spell" is a magic incantation or effect conjured by the caster, typically modeled after fantasy, myth, and legend. Spells in World Game can have various 
effects such as damage, healing, buffs (beneficial effects), or debuffs (harmful effects) on characters and creatures.

		Types of Magic Mechanics in World Game:

- "Ability" : A skill performed by a character class under specific circumstances. This can involve physical or magical damage, as well as buffs or debuffs.
  
- "Passive Ability" : An ability that remains active all the time or can be activated under certain circumstances. Some are learned through professions like 
"Mining" or "Fishing," while others come from quests or unique abilities, such as "Polymorph".

- "Skill" : Abilities used by monsters, which may include area-of-effect (AoE) abilities, debuffs, or buffs affecting them or their surroundings. Skills are grouped
into elemental schools:
	- "Earth Skills"
	- "Wind Skills"
	- "Fire Skills"
	- "Water Skills"
	- "Shadow Skills"
	- "Holy Skills"

		Additional Notes on Spells:
- "Casting Time" : Most spells require casting time, with some spells being "Instant Cast" (i.e., zero casting time) and others being "Channeled" (lasting for the entire casting duration). Some abilities are also mana, energy, or focus-dependent.
- "Resistance" : Spells may be subject to elemental resistances, depending on their school.

		Instant Spells

	An "Instant" spell or ability has a cast time of zero, meaning the effect happens immediately after activation (typically in less than half a second). Instant 
spells can be cast while moving, making them useful in combat, especially compared to spells that require standing still to cast.

		Key Features:
- "Can be cast while moving".
- "Cannot be interrupted", although they may be prevented by preemptive effects like stuns or silences.
- "No targeting restriction", as they can often be cast without facing the target.
- "Global cooldown applies", but they do not have their own separate cooldown time.  end

		Channeling Spells

	"Channeling" or "channeled abilities" require the caster to remain stationary during the entire duration of the ability, regularly causing effects such as 
"Damage over Time" (DoT) or "Heal over Time". 

		Key Features:
- The time bar for channeled spells goes from full (green) to empty.
- Interruptions : Attacks that hit the caster will drain the time bar. Certain attacks can completely interrupt the spell, filling the bar with red and displaying 
"Interrupted."
- Mana Consumption : Mana is consumed before channeling starts.
- Interruptibility : Players can interrupt their own channeling by moving, jumping, or pressing the "Escape" key.
- Prevention of Interruption : Some abilities, powers, or talents can prevent interruption.
