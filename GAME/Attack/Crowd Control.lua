			Crowd Control
			
	Crowd control (often abbreviated to CC) refers to spells and abilities which limit an opponents ability to participate in a fight. Crowd control abilities can be 
divided into two distinct categories: loss of control abilities, and positional control abilities. Also can be categories in three categories: "DoT", "Soft CCs" and
"Hard CCs".
	Loss of control abilities are such that when used, the target loses the ability to participate in a battle (be it an NPC or player). They are essentially taken out
of play for the duration of the controlling spell. Positional control abilities, however, do not remove control over the unit but may hinder it in some other form 
(target may still use its abilities to an extent). end 
	
	All Indoor bosses are more or less immune to all forms of crowd control depending of the individual script. Elite mobs may or may not have high resistance to, or 
be immune to, specific CC that would normally work on their non-elite counterparts.
