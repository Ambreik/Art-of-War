			Spell Hit

	"Spell Hit" refers to the success or failure of a spell cast by a character, typically a ranged caster, that does not require direct physical contact with the 
target. Instead, spells have a chance to hit based on accuracy, magical stats, or other factors. When a spell fails to hit, it is shown as a "miss," and it has no 
effect on the target.

		Key Points:
- "Spell Hit" is distinct from "Physical Hit", where physical contact with a weapon is required.
- Spells can miss their targets if they fail to land successfully, unlike physical attacks that may be dodged or blocked.
- Spell Hit is a key characteristic for magical classes who rely on casting spells from a distance rather than melee combat.
