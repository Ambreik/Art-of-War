			Combat
			
	Combat refers to a basic game system : a state in which the character is attacking (or about to attack) a selected target. While in this state, the character is 
restricted from some specific actions, such as eating.
	
		The combat flag
	When a character attacks or is attacked, he will be flagged by the game as being in combat. Many actions and abilities cannot be used while you are in combat, 
making knowing how to get into and out of combat very important, especially in PvP combat.
	In PvP, a player will leave combat if they have not attacked or been attacked for 5 seconds, or all the enemy characters that have attacked you are killed. end 
	Under most circumstances in PvE, once all monsters have lost interest in you, you will be removed from combat.
	
	Actions that will get you into combat Combat.png
*Attacking.
*Casting an offensive spell.
*Casting a buff or a healing spell on a unit that is in combat
*Getting on a mob's aggro list.
*Certain bosses always put everyone in the group in combat when engaged, regardless their distance from the boss.

		Abilities that cannot be used while in combat
	When in combat, several abilities become unavailable including drinking, eating, mounting, and accepting a summon. In addition:

	General
*Resurrection abilities may not be used, including items that resurrect.
*Drinking and eating are not possible while in combat.
*Pick Pocket.
 	Ninja
Ninja cannot use [Stealth] (passive ability) while in combat, although they can [Stealth] as their skill.

		Abilities that allow you to escape combat
	Some classes have abilities that remove them from combat instantly. However, if they are dotted they will usually be brought back into combat the next time they 
take damage. end 
	
	Ninja
*[Stealth] makes the assassins completely invisible for 52 seconds, then drops him into stealth. It is on a 2-minute cooldown.
	
		General combat concepts

	Aggro and adds
Using your favorite high-damage spell to pull a mob is not the best idea in the world. For one, it can make it very difficult for other players, such as warriors, to
pull it off you (in the case of taunt resists, etc), increasing the likelihood that you will go down. Secondly, high-threat spells have a much higher chance of 
pulling other creatures around the mob, which can also be dangerous. 

If you are in combat and you have undesirable aggro (on a low-armor character, for example) you may want to follow one of the following courses of action. Which one 
you choose depends on a variety of factors, including the class that is tanking, the talent build of that player, and his skill at maintaining aggro and the 
abilities at his disposal.

If the tank's build (and skill) allows him to build aggro on multiple mobs that he is tanking, you may want to change targets to one of the other mobs he has aggro 
on, and then switch back perhaps after he has established good aggro on the one that began attacking you.

If the tank's build (and skill) does not allow him to maintain good aggro on multiple mobs, you may want to just stop attacking for a while, or use an ability that 
you might have which reduces your aggro, and wait for a moment before commencing fire.

What you definitely do not want to do is run away from the mob in an undisciplined manner. It would be best to run towards the tank, so that he can see that you have
aggro. This of course may be unwise if the mob he is tanking deals damage in an area of effect. end end end 

	Mana and health
Keeping an eye on your mana and health before and during battle can mean the difference between life and death. Make sure to glance at it often. It is also a good 
idea to try to anticipate how much damage you will be taking during the battle so you know when it would be a good idea to use any cooldown abilities or a potion 
that may just save your life.

While in a group while questing or (more likely) going through a dungeon, it also helps to keep an eye on health and mana of the rest of your party. Especially for 
those who were designated to start the fights (i.e. Pull) you are going to put your companions and yourself into grave danger if you start a new fight while your 
main healer is still sitting down to get his mana back up. end end 

	Ranged weapons
Also called pulling, try to use a ranged weapon or spell to begin combat with most creatures in the distance. This gives you an extra hit before melee combat begins. 
If you have one, try to use a powerful attack to inflict the most damage before a fight. For example if you have a spell that sports a long casting time that is 
generally very difficult to use in combat, use that because of the amount of damage done.

Be careful with this tactic against ranged caster mobs, since melee combat can have the advantage of interrupting or delaying spells where ranged attacks generally 
give the caster ample casting time to cast spells.

An advanced tactic to use in combination with a range weapon or spell is to try and perpetually run away from your opponent in circles (making sure you don't aggro 
anything else of course) allowing yourself just enough time to get a hit off but proceed running. This is called kiting. If done properly the opponent may never lay 
a finger on you.

	Running away
Never eliminate the option of running away, if a battle starts going badly. end 

Watch how much damage per hit an opponent does and when you get to about half health, you might want to think about running if you can't heal or won't kill the 
opponent before you die. Especially consider running, if you are fighting more than one opponent. Note that many humanoid mobs will flee themselves when they are at 
15% of their normal health level (on average; some mobs will run before they reach 15%, and some don't run until they are very close to dying). However, after a few 
seconds of wandering off, they will return to fight you. Be careful, usually they take this time to bring more mobs with them if possible. end end end end 

	Good times to run
*Many mobs won't follow you into water (river, lake, sea or ocean), but beware of water mobs, amphibious mobs (such as crocolisks or murlocs), or humanoids that can 
swim. They will swim at your normal run speed, but you will swim at reduced speed.
*Conversely, many water mobs won't follow you on land, but also beware of amphibious mobs.
*Also beware of mobs that have a ranged attack. They can pelt you from afar with spells and the like if you're slowly swimming in water. Usually though, these types 
of mobs won't chase you very far.
*Run to friendly guard NPCs, since they will sometimes aid you, and most likely there are no enemy mobs in such an area.
*Run to player characters not fighting who are around or higher than the level of the mob. Sometimes they will help you out, but not always. Be aware that it can be 
considered poor etiquette to "train" mobs over to another player.
	Some things not to do when running
*Don't run where there are other mobs whom you might aggro.
*Don't run toward a hill or mountain or a valley that might lead to a dead end or require a lot of maneuvering to get around.
*Don't run off a cliff that may kill you from the drop.
*Don't make a lot of turns and try to "juke" the mob. The AI, executing on the server, is infinitely responsive and will "head you off at the pass" and catch up 
that much faster.

	Useful things anyone can do before you run or while running
*Drink a healing potion (or any equivalent) if you have it.
*Yell for help in some way (/say, /yell, etc.).
*Watch for and avoid obstacles like fences and walls; these will slow or stop a player without affecting a pursuing mob.
*If you have enough health to take a few more hits from the mob, turn around (if that is necessary) and use a movement impairing effect or a stun effect on it, then 
proceed running.
*Quickly strafing (sidestepping) left and right while running away will make it easier to escape mobs in pursuit.
*Drink a Swiftness Potion, if you have one. This is an easy way to put quick distance between you and most pursuers.

		Physical combat
	
	Melee vs. ranged
The choice between melee and ranged combat depends mostly on your class. Most classes have all their best abilities in one category. Some are lucky enough to have 
some abilities designed to help them switch to their preferred range. Below are tactics for keeping your foe at your preferred range (especially when it is not 
theirs).

	Dual wielding
Your total damage output when fighting with two weapons should be higher than fighting with one weapon and a shield, but roughly equal to fighting with a two-handed 
weapon. Off-hand weapon attacks deal 50% of the weapon's designated damage. Therefore, it's wise to always put the best "damage dealer" weapon in the main hand. Dual 
wielding also increases your base miss chance using the formula 80% Ã— M + 20% where M is your miss chance when not dual-wielding. Your usual miss chance against an 
opponent of equal level is 5% which means the typical miss chance while dual-wielding is 24%.

		
		Magic
	
	Resistance
Don't forget that opponents of a much higher level than you have a fair chance of resisting any magical attacks, so don't always rely on initial crowd control, 
damage, or root/snare spells to set up a fight. Don't be unprepared if the target resists a spell or two.

Also consider specific types of spells against targets that might have specific types of resistances. Magical cold or water mobs might have a frost resistance, for 
example.

	Cast time and interruption
The longer it takes to cast a spell, the more times you're going to get whacked (further delaying the spell) and the more likely it is that your opponent will be 
able to use a stun or other spell-interrupting skill on you.This is of particular importance in PvP since the other player has to react fast enough to interrupt you,
and a faster spell gives them a smaller time to do that.

		Damage avoidance
	
Melee combat is resolved using a chart of possible results for each attack. The sequence of results is: auto-crit (a target not standing up is always critically hit,
and this value is either 0% or 100% for each attack), miss, dodge, glancing blow (players versus monsters only), block, critical hit, crushing blow (monsters 
versus players only), and finally a normal hit. If the percentage chances add up to more than 100% then latter results will not be performed at the expected % rate 
because the random roll used to get a result from the chart is from only 1 to 100.

Ways of avoiding damage are miss, dodge, evade, block, absorb, resist, immune, and reflect. There's also an hypothetical deflect outcome about which we need more 
information.


	Miss
Only applicable to physical damage. Any physical attack, assuming that both attacker and attacked are the same level and have no modifiers to their hit rate, has a 
5% chance to miss.
	
	Dodge
Only applicable to melee attacks. Your chance to dodge is increased by agility and defense.

	Evade
Applicable to any type of damage, or even non-damaging debuff. A mob that is in a position where the game believes players are using an exploit to avoid being 
damaged will go into Evade mode at which point it is effectively immune to all attacks.
	
	Absorb
Applicable to any type of damage. This is usually the result of having a buff, which absorbs a limited amount of damage before failing. 
Certain shields can only absorb certain kinds of damage, so read the description before wondering why you're still getting hurt.
	
	Resist
Only applicable to magical damage. This is basically the magical version of a miss. Your chance to resist a spell or other effect is based on your resist of that 
element, as well as your level. You can also partially resist some spells, taking only 25%, 50%, or 75% of the normal damage.
	
	Immune
Applicable to any type of damage. This is the result of a mob having a coded ability to be immune to certain attacks (i.e.  [Scorpid Sting] does not work on most 
bosses) or a player using some skill or item to protect them from damage. These are either permanent (mob immunity) and will not fail regardless of how much damage 
you throw at it.

	Reflect
Applicable on non-AoE spells only. A Reflected spell will bounce back to its caster, acting as if it was cast on him.
