			Hit

	Hit refers to physical damage dealt as a result of an attack made with melee or ranged weapons. It also represents a character's chance to land a successful 
attack without missing. 

- "Hit Chance" : Characters generally have a 100% chance to hit when fighting creatures up to 3 levels higher, including bosses. However, this chance decreases when
fighting enemies higher than 3 levels above the character, often resulting in a reduction in damage dealt.
- "PvP" and "PvM" : In both PvP and PvM, the term "hit" is used to refer to any physical attack made with a weapon, even if the character is of a magical class but using a weapon to strike an opponent. In contrast, some magical creatures or classes may have "magical hits" or "spell hits," which are treated differently.

		Auto Attacks

	For each melee auto-attack made by a character against a mob, the outcome is determined in the following order of precedence:

| Order of Precedence | Result            |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1                   | Hit               |
| 2                   | Dodge/Miss        |
| 3                   | Hit               |
| 4                   | Hit               |
| 5                   | Block             |
| 6                   | Critical Strike   |
| 7                   | Hit               |

	This order applies to "High Ranked Monsters", "Special Monsters", "Elite Monsters", "Special Bosses", or "NM".

#### Special Attacks

For each melee special attack made by a character against a mob, the result follows this order of precedence:

| Order of Precedence | Result            |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1                   | Hit               |
| 2                   | Hit               |
| 3                   | Miss              |
| 4                   | Hit               |
| 5                   | Block             |

This applies to normal monsters throughout the Game World up to **Rank III**.
