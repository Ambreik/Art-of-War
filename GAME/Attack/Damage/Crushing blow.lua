			Crushing blow

	A crushing blow is a normal hit or critical hit by an NPC that deals 150% of the damage it would otherwise cause. A player cannot perform a crushing blow (unless 
under [Mind Control], in which case they are treated as mobs).

		Chance of a crushing blow occurring
	When the attacking mob is more than 5 levels above the target, there is a chance of being struck by a crushing blow. If the level difference is only 4, which is 
common for players being attacked by "boss" mobs (who are always treated as 4 levels higher than their attackers), then the player cannot be hit by a crushing blow.

	The chance of being hit by a crushing blow is:

		((Mob's Level * 5) - (Player's Level * 5) [mininum difference 20]) * 2% - 15%

	This means a mob 4 levels higher than you will have a 25% Crushing Blow chance, and a mob 5 levels higher than you will have a 35% Crushing Blow chance.
	
	There are some exceptions where some monsters have this ability to use this attack against character players without counting the level difference.
