			Multistrike
			
	Multistrike is an attack used by some monsters, that provided a chance for spells and abilities to fire up to two additional times, at 30% effectiveness (both 
damage and healing).
	When is trigger, "Multistrike" doesnt require additional mana cost or casting time but a delay of 2 seconds between cast also an effect of dark purple effect 
around the monster. In other words, sometimes the ability would hit just once for normal damage. Sometimes it would hit twice, with the second hit dealing 30% damage.

	Notes
*Only the initial attack could generate procs.
*For Direct attacks, Multistrike was decided upon cast, not when the attack landed.
*Damage Over Time spells could multistrike, with ticks getting two chances just like a direct damage spell. 
*Ignite ticks couldn't multistrike. However, if a spell that could contribute to Ignite damage scored a multistrike, its additional hits would also contribute Ignite 
damage.

	Only some monsters can benefit from this attack and is not imply for a specific Rank, type, class or race.
