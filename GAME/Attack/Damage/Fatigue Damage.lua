			Fatigue Damage
			
	Fatigue Damage occure when a character goes into a fatigue zone and the bar deplete over time dealing damage to the player when it reaches zero.
	The Fatigue bar and Fatigue damage occurs regardless of the player's depth. (i.e. swimming on the surface, diving, water walking or even flying over a Fatigue 
region will cause this). Players may swim back toward shallower waters to refill the fatigue bar and avoid death. 
	
	The Fatigue damage can be seen in the Combat Log.
System Message : <You received Fatigue Damage, go back to safety !>
	The damage done is equal to 20% of your max HP every 5 seconds. It is possible to reduce the damage of every tick by removing any gear or buffs that grant bonus HP
or stamina, but this often comes at the cost of losing mana required for healing through the Fatigue itself.
