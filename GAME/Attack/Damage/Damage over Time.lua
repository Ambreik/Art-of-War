			Damage over Time

	Damage over Time, generally abbreviated as DoT or simply dot, refers to inflicting some damage on one's foe which will be applied at a regular interval for a 
limited duration. Abilities and debuffs that inflict damage over time are referred to as DoTs. Some AoE effects also deal damage over time.

	Typically in World Game, the damage from DoTs is applied every X seconds, in ticks. Every X seconds the DoT will 'tick', dealing damage. Ticks usually deal a 
regular amount of damage, but in some cases this amount increases, with later ticks dealing more. Each DoT has a base number of ticks, and a base tick frequency (often
once every 3 seconds), which multiply to equal the total duration of the effect. Haste can increase the speed of ticks, causing damage to be dealt more quickly, and if
sufficient, will result in extra ticks being added to the effect, roughly maintaining the overall duration of the DoT but greatly increasing both its total damage (and
therefore cost efficiency) and the speed at which it deals damage. end 

	DoTs may be applied using a variety of methods â€” from a spell, a trap, a weapon, a poison, or some other form. Most DoTs are target specific, but some are also 
used as Area of Effect (AoE) attacks.

	Damage over Time effects are most effective when they are allowed to run their full course. Also, DPS based on multiple DoTs has a significant ramp-up time as it 
takes several Global Cooldowns to apply them all to a target. As such, DoTs provide sustained DPS, without the "burst damage" of an equivalent Direct Damage attack.
	DoTs in PvE are most effective in extended fights against one or more long-lived targets, and least effective in short trash pulls where the targets are downed 
quickly, or fights that require frequent switching to new targets. Specs relying on DoTs often lack burst capabilities, or may have to use an alternate rotation (often
not involving DoTs) when burst damage is required. DoT-reliant specs must decide early on whether DoTs will be required for dealing with any given target; applying 
them to a target that is quickly downed is a waste of mana and potential damage output, while failing to apply them to a target that takes a more significant time to 
defeat will usually result in similar waste of mana and damage output, due to the substitution of less desirable damage-dealing abilities. DoT-reliant Warlocks and 
Shamans can find it hard to maintain competitive DPS against trash without high-end gear, and will often fall back solely on Area of Effect spells in those situations.

	One significant advantage of most DoTs is the ability to apply them to an unlimited number of targets. This allows these specs to deal huge amounts of damage on 
multiple targets, albeit relatively slowly and in a manner that is often easy for healers to respond to with multiple-target heals. 
	
	One limitation of DoTs is their ability to break crowd control effects, such as  [Polymorph]. Some crowd control spells can be modified to remove all DoTs from the 
target, preventing this conflict.
