			Direct damage

	Direct damage or DD, is a term used to refer to damage that is dealt in one burst, as opposed to the periodic damage of damage over time (DoT) effects. Direct 
damage is dealt as soon as the spell or ability takes effect, making it excellent for dealing burst damage. Spells that deal substantial amounts of direct damage may be known as direct damage spells. Spells that have both direct damage and damage over time components are known as hybrid spells.
