			Fall damage

	Fall damage is environmental damage inflicted upon a player when they fall from a certain height. Death caused by fall damage causes the same 10% durability loss 
to equipment as a normal PvE death.

	Water does not cause any falling damage unless player hits the ground underwater, also if player is under some sort of "Water Walking" effects before submerging to 
water the damage will be caused as much as it would on normal ground.

		Damage mitigation
	Fall damage can be completely avoided by falling into a body of water (just make sure you land in deep water if you're falling from a very high place; falling far 
enough will cause you to become submerged, meaning shallow water might not save you). Fall damage can also be mitigated by various items, abilities, and skills. As 
with all other environmental damage (except fire damage), fall damage cannot be mitigated by regular damage absorption abilities.
