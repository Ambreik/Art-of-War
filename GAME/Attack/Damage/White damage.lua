			White damage

	White damage is damage dealt from your common abilities that consume no mana, energy, focus or rage. This includes auto-attack, shoot, auto-shot, and the 
like. It is so called because the value of the damage is displayed on screen in white as opposed to yellow.
	A white crit would be any crit of a white-damage attack.
	
	Also all monsters under player level with more than 10 levels that deal no significant damage have white damage.
	Also all monsters that deal damage to a character that have enough "Element Resistance" for that specific monster, deal no significant damage.
