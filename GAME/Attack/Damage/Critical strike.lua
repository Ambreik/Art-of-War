			Critical strike
	
	Critical strike (often abbreviated as "crit") refers to 100% bonus physical damage (twice your normal damage) that occurs as a result of an attack made with melee
or ranged weapons. Chance to critical strike can be viewed in the character panel under melee stats and is affected by agility, critical strike, and talents. Some 
classes have talents that increase the amount of bonus damage for critical strikes or talents that increase their critical strike chance. Attacks made by mobs can not
result in a blocked critical strike, but this can result on a player attack. It can also be viewed by opening the character sheet. 

		Critical strike
	Critical strike is a combat rating found on gear, enchants, and gems. Critical strike affects melee or ranged attacks only.
	
		Agility
	The agility you need to acquire 1% critical hit chance depends on your class and level. Keep in mind everyone has a base crit of 5% from agility. Only agility on 
gear adds to the base of 5%.
