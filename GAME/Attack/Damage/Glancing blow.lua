			Glancing blow

	Glancing blows are combat events that can occur when fighting a mob more than 5 levels higher.
	These occur only on white damage and result in the attack having its damage reduced in proportion to the difference between the attacker's weapon skill (capped at 
the attacker's level * 5), and the target's defense skill.
	At current Glancing blows occur at about 20% of the time versus mobs that are above your level. These attacks only do 75% to 85% of their normal damage versus a 
mob that is 5 levels above you in most circumstances. Bosses are counted as "your level+5" in some circumstances. end 
	Against mobs with defense roughly equal to or higher than your Attack Rating (i.e. your weapon skill), you will have a chance to land a glancing blow instead of a 
normal hit. A glancing blow only occurs on white melee damage and does less damage than a normal blow. If the attacker's weapon skill is less than his level * 5, the 
damage reduction will be proportional to the difference between the attacker's weapon skill and the target's defense.
	
		Effect from weapon skill
	Weapon skill greater than the normal max for your level (i.e. your level * 5) does not reduce the chance for a glancing blow to land.
	Extra weapon skill did reduce the severity of the damage reduction, but this is no longer the case.
	Glancing blows do not occur against players, only against mobs. At present ranged attacks do not result in glancing blows. end end
