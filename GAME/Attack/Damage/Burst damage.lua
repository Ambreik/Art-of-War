			Burst damage

	Burst damage is a term used to describe dealing high amounts of damage in a very short period of time. Spells which qualify for burst damage are often mana 
inefficient. Burst damage may refer to a short period of focused damage dealing, or simply a quick flurry of powerful attacks. Burst damage may also refer to some PvE 
encounters in which a boss will inflict a lot of damage in a short time.
	Burst damage can be achieved in a number of ways: using powerful but inefficient spells or abilities rather than a more sustainable rotation to maximise damage 
output; blowing powerful cooldowns to increase damage dealt for a short period; or using procs, stacks of buffs/debuffs and secondary resources to provide substantial 
temporary bonuses to damage dealt. Numerous abilities have synergies rewarding their use in combination with other attacks, making them perfect for dealing quick 
bursts of damage.
	Maximum burst damage output is often achieved by combining all possible sources of burst, such as by using several damage-enhancing cooldowns all at once. 
Combined, these effects often produce a remarkable - if temporary - increase in damage output. However, focusing on burst damage can cause players to run out of 
resources such as mana much faster, or leave them without cooldowns to fall back on if things turn sour. end end 
	In PvE, dealing burst damage has a chance of drawing aggro, making it inefficient and even dangerous as a means of beating bosses in most cases. However, in some 
encounters, burst damage is necessary. Burst damage can be very useful when a boss will soon enrage, or when an add must be quickly destroyed.

	Correctly managing burst damage is one of the most powerful techniques in PvP. It usually aims to bring an enemy down fast, giving enemy healers as little chance 
as possible to heal the damage inflicted. When several players focus their burst damage on a single target, the combined onslaught can be extremely difficult to 
survive. Players often seek to counter cooldown-enhanced burst damage through using crowd control to suspend the player from play while their cooldowns expire. Periods 
of burst damage are particularly effective when healers are temporarily incapacitated. Focused application of burst damage often forces players to employ defensive 
and/or evasive cooldowns to survive.

	Dealing quick spikes of burst damage is a potent ability in PvP, due to the potential to surprise and overwhelm players. Slow and predictable damage is relatively 
easy for players to manage, predict and respond to, while unpredictable burst damage is capable of swiftly overwhelming opponents, and is far harder for healers to 
anticipate and react to in sufficient time. Players can also be easily panicked by spikes of damage, leading them to waste powerful cooldowns. This type of burst 
damage is of minimal benefit in PvE.
