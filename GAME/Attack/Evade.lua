			Evade

	"Evade" is an NPC-exclusive avoidance mechanic. It is triggered in the following situations:

1. "Terrain Limitations" : When a mob is unable to reach its target, such as when the terrain blocks its path. For example, the mob may be stuck due to obstacles like
rocks or cliffs.
   
2. "Leashing" : When the mob is running back to its original position after having chased a player for too long or a player has moved too far beyond the mob's aggro 
range.

	Purpose : The Evade mechanic is designed to discourage players from exploiting terrain to avoid combat.It forces players to engage enemies in a more balanced way,
avoiding unfair advantages.

- In Evade Mode : The mob becomes immune to all attacks and spells from players. Additionally, it regenerates health as though it were out of combat, making it 
effectively invulnerable until the evade condition ends.

- Regaining Attackable Status : If a mob enters evade mode due to terrain limitations, players must move closer to the mob. Once the player is within range, the mob 
will drop its evade status and become attackable again.

- Evade Triggered by Traps : Some mobs can be caught in specific areas, like between rocks or in other impassable zones. While these mobs can still aggro players and 
initiate combat, they cannot be attacked at range. The player must get within melee range to successfully deal damage.

- Challenging Spawn Locations : Occasionally, mobs may spawn in tricky or difficult locations where itâ€™s hard to attack them without triggering evade. This situation is commonly encountered in boss encounters , where the spawn points might be limited by terrain, or in high-level monster encounters.
