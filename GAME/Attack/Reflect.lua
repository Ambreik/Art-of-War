			Reflect

	"Reflection", also called "Spell Reflection", is a defensive mechanic that allows players and mobs to avoid a spell and reflect it back at the caster. It is a 
highly flexible but rare avoidance mechanic.

		Key Features:
- "Targeted Spells" : Only targeted spells can be reflected; "Area of Effect" (AoE) spells cannot. For spells that hit multiple targets but are still targeted, the 
reflect can happen individually for each target.
  
		Reflect Effects:
- Tank Classes : Certain tank abilities in "Battle" and "Defensive Stance" allow for spell reflection.
- Mobs : Some enemies have a native chance to reflect spells or abilities that enable them to reflect spells.
- Items & Consumables : Specific items and consumables can grant a chance to reflect spells.
- Plate Armor Bonus : Spell reflection can be found as a bonus on "plate armor" starting from level 70+.
- Armor Enhancement : Reflective bonuses can also be added to armor through enchantment or refinement.
- Inner Core System : The "Inner Core" can be used to enhance reflection chances.

		Mechanic:
- Reflected spells behave as if they directly target the caster.
  - The spell is treated as if the caster is both the source and the target of the spell.
  - It is not possible for spells to be reflected more than once, as further reflection would not change the target.
  - The damage done by the reflected spell is still considered to be caused by the caster, not the reflector.
  - All spell-enhancing effects (e.g., talents, procs) are taken solely from the caster. Talents and effects from the reflector do not influence the spell's outcome.
  - Any secondary effects of the spell (such as debuffs or buffs) will be incurred by the caster, although not all secondary effects will affect them.
