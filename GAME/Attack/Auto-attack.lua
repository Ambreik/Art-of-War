			Auto-attack

	An auto-attack is any type of player or pet attack that occurs automatically and repeats unless interrupted by the player or other events. Auto-attacks function 
separately from specific abilities and do not interfere with their usage. The auto-attack targets the player's current target and continues until canceled or the 
target dies.

	Auto-attacks operate with an internal swing or cast timer, which is not visible to the player but determines how often attacks occur. If the target moves out of 
range, the auto-attack will stop, only resuming when the target is back within range, or when a new target is selected. Auto-attacks will also stop when the character
is affected by crowd control effects such as stuns or fears, resuming once the effect ends.

	The speed of auto-attacks is determined by the equipped weapon(s). Melee special attacks and some self-healing abilities do not interrupt an auto-attack. 
Auto-attack damage can be improved by several passive abilities, including the "Combo" passive.

- "Melee" : Auto-attacks are a primary source of damage for melee classes and generally generate Rage. They can trigger passive abilities and interact with abilities that affect melee attacks. Melee auto-attacks provide a steady flow of damage while the player uses more specific abilities. Initiating a hostile melee attack or using a melee ability will trigger auto-attack.

- "Ranged" : Ranged weapon auto-attacks function similarly, repeating automatically until the target moves out of range.
