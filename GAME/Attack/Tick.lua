			Tick

	A "Tick" is a time increment used for "over time effects" such as "Channeling", "Damage over Time" (DoT), "Healing over Time" (HoT), etc. 

- "Tick Interval" : One tick occurs every time the spell's overtime effect triggers.
- "Frequency" : While many overtime effects tick every two seconds, the interval is not universal, and some effects may tick at different intervals.
