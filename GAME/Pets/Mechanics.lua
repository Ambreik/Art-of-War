Pets are first found as wild animals that have to be tamed using the skill Charm Animal. The Zaishen Menagerie can offer to breed animal companions if specific requirements are filled.
Pets will appear as long as their master has any of the ranger skills Charm Animal, Comfort Animal (PvE), or Heal as One (PvE) equipped when entering a combat zone.
Although pets are subject to usual AI issues, they have a faster movement or attack speed to compensate. In PvE they take 33% less damage and deal 33% more damage compared to a regular ally.
A player can make its pet the main part of its strategy. To draw out the pet's full potential, however, investing attribute points in Beast Mastery is required, as the damage dealt by the pet as well as the effectiveness of most pet-related skills scale with the attribute.

	Behavior
*Like all creatures, pets gain experience, to a maximum level of 90 for some. Their appearance is based on which species of charmable animal they are and their level, 
which determines their size.
*Pets follow their owners and use standard melee attacks or ranged depending on which species they are. The pet AI behavior is similar to that of minions: they attack 
and move to the owner's target. However, like characters, pets can be directed using the pet interface screen which allows the owner to order their pet to heel, to 
guard, or to lock target.
