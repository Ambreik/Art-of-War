			Quest

		Overview
	A quest is a task assigned to the player character, yielding a reward upon completion. Quests are primarily provided by NPCs but can also originate from 
specific interactions, such as:
- Clicking signs (e.g., wanted posters).
- Reading scrolls/documents.
- Opening containers.
- Using looted items labeled with "Begins a quest".
- Completing a preceding quest in a chain.

	Rewards include "XP", "gold", "reputation", and items. Upon reaching the maximum level, players receive gold instead of XP for most quests.

	Quest XP Mechanics
- Full XP is awarded for quests when "Character_Level ≤ Quest_Level + 4*", diminishing with increasing level difference.
- Lower-level quests (Quest_Level < 10) follow slightly altered scaling.

---

		Quest Starting Points
	Players begin with quests based on:
1. "Race/Class-Specific Quests" : Unique to the character's starting race and class.
2. "General Quests" : Available to all players in the starting zones.

- Quest items or objects can be activated (e.g., dropped items or fixed quest objects).
- Completing quests sequentially within a region before progressing minimizes XP loss from "gray" quests and ensures proper item scaling.

	Impact and Balance Considerations

- Quest Overload : With so many quest types, there's a chance players may feel overwhelmed. However, balancing quest frequency, ensuring quest categories are accessible based on player progression, and limiting the number of available quests at once will mitigate this.
  
- Pacing : Not all quest types need to be available at all times. Players can be directed to specific types of quests based on their level, class, or events. For example:
   - "Class Quests" are unlocked early and guide players through their journey.
   - "Hero-Challenging Quests" and "Raid Quests" can be introduced later for endgame content.

- Player Flexibility : Some quests should be optional, with multiple paths (e.g., pursuing main storyline quests or engaging in more casual or repeatable quests for
resources). This prevents players from feeling forced into a particular playstyle.

- World Impact : Quests like "World Quests" or "Guild Quests" should tie into larger events or changes in the game world, making them feel meaningful and not just 
for resource collection.
