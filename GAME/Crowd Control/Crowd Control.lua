			Crowd Control

	Crowd Control (CC) refers to abilities or spells that remove or diminish the control a target unit has over itself. This can include impairing its ability to 
cast spells, issue movement or attack commands, or perform actions. These effects are considered specialized debuffs, but because they directly hinder a unitâ€™s 
combat capabilities, they are often viewed as more significant than normal debuffs, leading to their classification as "crowd control."

	Crowd control can take many forms, each unique in how it impairs affected units and how it can be resisted, mitigated, or cleansed, if at all. While most types 
of crowd control can be applied by characters, monsters, and NPCs, many are often exclusive to NPCs or monsters.

		Crowd Control Effects

	Crowd control can disable the following:
- "Movement"
- "Attack"
- "Casting Abilities"
- "Casting Summoner Spells"

	It can also "interrupt channels".

		Types of Crowd Control

	There are three distinct types of CC:
- "DoT" (Damage over Time) : Inflicts damage over time in regular intervals for a set duration.
- "Soft CC" : Effects that can be partially or fully cured or removed.
- "Hard CC" : Effects that cannot be cured or removed under normal circumstances.

		Categories of Crowd Control

	To simplify discussions, crowd control effects are grouped into the following categories:

1. "Loss of Control" : 
   - "Total CC" : Also known as "hard CC," which fully removes control over a target.
   - "Partial CC" : Known as "soft CC," these effects do not completely remove control but still significantly impair it.

2. "Disrupting" : 
   - "Disrupting CC" : Affects channeled abilities. These are referred to as cast-inhibiting crowd control and can disable casting. 
   - "Ground and Root" : Only interrupt channeled movement abilities.

3. "Immobilizing" : 
   - "Immobilizing CC" : Inhibits movement.
   - "Non-Immobilizing CC" : Does not directly affect movement.

4. "Impaired Movement and Actions" : 
   - "Movement Impairing" : Impairs movement but not actions.
   - "Action Impairing" : Impairs actions like attacking, casting, or moving.

	Increasing the Duration of Crowd Control

- Certain units (characters, Guardians, and Barons) can increase the duration of crowd control through "Resilience" found on "Armor" or "Necklaces". 
- Each point of "Resilience" increases the duration by 0.1 seconds.

		Countering Crowd Control

	Crowd control can be countered in various ways:

- "Immunity" : 
   - "Complete Immunity" negates the application of any CC on the unit. However, already-applied CC effects will still persist unless explicitly removed. 
   - Example: "Immune to Blackout" offers immunity against "Stun."

- "Partial Immunity" : 
   - This reduces the chance or duration of a CC.
   - Example: "Defence against Blackouts" provides partial immunity to "Stun."

- "Removal" : 
   - Certain spells or abilities can remove or cure crowd control effects. This can be done through character skills, pet abilities, or Guardian/Baron abilities.

		Types of Crowd Control

1. "Damage over Time" (DoT) :
   - "DoT" effects inflict damage over time at regular intervals.
   - Specific DoT types:
     - "Bleed" : Applies via physical damage (e.g., weapon effects), causing a burst of 4.3% current HP damage every second for 10 seconds.
     - "Fire" : Applies via magical damage from fire-based monsters or skills, causing a burst of 4.3% current HP damage every second for 10 seconds.
     - "Frost" : Applies via special monster skills, causing a burst of 7% current HP damage every second for 5 seconds.
     - "Poison" : Applies via physical or magical damage, dealing 3% current HP damage every second for 22 seconds, with a final 5% burst for the last 3.6 seconds.
     - "Intoxication" : Applies via physical damage, causing a burst of **5% current HP damage every second for 10 seconds**.

   - "DoT UI Indicators" :
     - "Bleed" : Red UI
     - "Fire" : Orange UI
     - "Frost" : Blue UI
     - "Poison" : Green UI
     - "Intoxication" : Purple UI

2. "Soft CC" :
   - Soft CCs are disabilities that leave the target vulnerable, usually by disabling actions like movement or attacks for a short period.
   - Soft CCs last about 4 seconds and can stack up to 5 times before the first CC expires.
   - Soft CCs can be cured by specific skills such as:
     - Shaman Healer's - "Cure"
     - Warlock Sorcerer's - "Burning Spirit"
   - Soft CC effects are characterized by a "yellow UI" and include the following:
     - Disables movement
     - Random movement behavior
     - Disables basic attacks and skills
     - Interrupts channeled skills
     - Ignores resilience
     - Can be prevented by "control immunity"

3. "Hard CC" :
   - Hard CCs are severe effects that completely incapacitate the target for a set duration. They generally cannot be cured by normal methods.
   - These effects are represented by a "red UI" and can:
     - Disable movement
     - Cause random movement behavior
     - Disables basic attacks and skills
     - Interrupt skills (including channeled skills)
     - Disable blink/charge skills
     - Ignore resilience
     - May or may not be prevented by control immunity
