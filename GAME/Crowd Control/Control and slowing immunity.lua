			Control Immunity (Crowd Control Immunity)
			
	Definition : This is a status effect that grants immunity to all forms of crowd control effects (CC) except suppressed effects, meaning that the character/monster
/NPC/pet/mount/Guardian/Baron will be immune to being controlled during this state.

	Note : Activating this immunity does not remove any existing crowd control effects, but it prevents new CC effects from being applied.
	Visual Cues : When control immunity is active, the character may glow orange or green, but some cases may not show a visual cue.
