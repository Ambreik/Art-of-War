			Frost (Damage over Time - DoT)

	Type : Frost is a special form of "Damage over Time" (DoT) and is classified as a type of "Crowd Control" (CC).

	Source :
- Frost can only be used by specific "special monsters", "Bosses", or "Elite monsters" in "Frozen Territories", applying their skills to affect characters.

	Frost Mechanics :
1. Duration : Frost lasts for 5 seconds on the affected target.
2. Damage :
   - Every second, a burst of 7% of the current HP is dealt as damage due to the ice effect breaking on the character.
3. Cure :
   - Frost cannot be cured by any character skills.
   - Only items can offer a small chance to protect the character from this DoT.
4. Slowdown Effect :
   - In addition to dealing damage, Frost also applies a "Slowdown" effect to the target.
5. Status Icon :
   - When affected by Frost, the target will have a status icon indicating the presence of the ice effect.

	Additional Notes :
- Frost is a "DoT effect" that can slow down the target while dealing damage over time, making it especially dangerous in prolonged engagements.
- It cannot be easily cured or mitigated by skills, which adds strategic importance to using the right items for protection.
