			Poison (Damage over Time - DoT)

	Type : Poison is a form of "Damage over Time" (DoT) and is classified as a type of "Crowd Control" (CC).

	Source :
- Poison can be applied through physical or magical damage, but it is most commonly applied by hits from monsters.
- Characters can also inflict "Poison" when their weapon carries a "Poison bonus".

	Poison Mechanics :

1. Duration :
   - For Monsters (PvE) : Poison lasts for 22 seconds on the affected target.
   - For Players (PvP) : Poison lasts for 8 seconds when affecting another player in combat to ensure balanced gameplay.  
     (This is to prevent outlaws with special bonuses from gaining an unfair advantage in PvP).

2. Damage :
   - Every second, a burst of 3% of the current HP is dealt as damage.
   - In the final 3.6 seconds of the Poison effect, the burst increases to 5% every 1.2 seconds.
   - This burst damage scaling applies to both PvE and PvP versions, though PvP only lasts for 8 seconds, with no damage scaling in the final portion.

3. Cure :
   - Poison can be cured by specific items or abilities, including the [Cure] skill or the [Burning Spirit] skill from Healers or Sorcerers.

4. Resistance to Poison :
   - "Resistance to Poison" is a bonus that reduces the duration of Poison’s effect on a target. It can be found in the following values:
     - 2%, 5%, 8%, 15% — each percentage reduces the duration of Poison by that amount.

5. Chance to Poison :
   - "Chance to Poison" is a bonus commonly found on weapons that gives the chance to apply the Poison DoT to the target. This can be found in the following values:
     - 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% — this indicates the probability of applying Poison when the weapon hits.

6. Status Icon :
   - When affected by Poison, the target will have a status icon indicating that they are poisoned.

	Additional Notes :
- Poison is a "DoT effect" that damages over time, making it effective in prolonged combat.
- It can be "cured" or mitigated with the right items or abilities, offering strategic options for both players and NPCs affected by it.
- "Outlaws" in "Alaban" can obtain "The Art of Poison Crafting", a special bonus that allows them to use the longer duration Poison DoT in PvP (similar to PvE), 
adding a unique advantage in combat.
