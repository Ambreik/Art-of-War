			Interrupt

	Interruption refers to slowing or stopping a target's spellcasting.

		There are two main types of interruption:
*Interruption caused by damage (also known as pushback).
*Interruption caused by specific abilities.

		Interruption caused by damage (pushback)
	Whenever a damaging spell or ability hits a caster mid-cast, the cast time will be set back by a given amount, slowing and delaying the cast. In contrast, 
pushback foreshortens channelled spells, causing them to end earlier without having had their full effect, but does not slow or delay them. Pushback therefore 
reduces the speed of cast-time spells, while reducing the mana efficiency of channelled spells.
	In general any melee attack (be it a normal or a special attack) or direct damage spell will cause interruption. Damage over Time spells and most channelled 
spells will not cause interruption. 
*When casting a spell: The first and second hit will add .5 secs each to the cast time. All hits after the second will have no effect.
*When channeling a spell: The first and second hit reduce current duration by 25% of total duration each. All hits after the second will have no effect.

	Notes
*Completely absorbed damage does not cause interruption; however, as soon as a part of the damage is not absorbed, it does.
*Resistance to pushback caused by damage can be provided by spells, either for the caster, for a chosen target or for multiple targets. Some equipment can also 
reduce pushback.
*Certain passives reduce pushback substantially.

		Interruption caused by specific abilities
	Numerous abilities can be used to immediately interrupt spellcasting. When a player's spellcasting is interrupted, their cast is immediately cancelled, and 
their cast time bar will turn red and say "Interrupted". Cast-time spells that are interrupted mid-cast will not consume mana, and any global cooldown will be 
cancelled, allowing the caster to immediately cast another spell.

	Interrupt abilities
*Abilities that specifically interrupt spell-casting are known as "interrupts". These abilities generally do not cause damage, are instant cast and unaffected by the 
global cooldown, allowing their use at any time. If a spell is successfully interrupted, they also cause a counterspell effect, preventing the target from casting any
spell as the interrupted spell for a number of seconds. Counterspell effects provide no visual debuff and cannot be dispelled. Interrupts are available to all classes
and races.
*Interruption can be prevented by certain abilities.
*Silence effects and many forms of crowd control such as "Fear", "Horrify", "Stuns", "Incapacitate" and  "Polymorph" can also be used to interrupt a target's cast. 
Proper use of these abilities can be very effective for interrupting spellcasting, although they lack the counterspell effect of true interrupts.
*Some abilities incorporate both silence effects and interrupts. This allows for interrupt functionality against PvE targets such as bosses that are immune to silence
effects.
