			Charm (Hard Crowd Control)

	Type : "Charm" effects are a form of "Hard Crowd Control" (Hard CC) that grants control of the affected victim to the caster.  

	Mechanics :  
- Direct Control : The caster gains the ability to control the victim as though it were a "pet" or their own character.  
- Indirect Control : The charmed target switches sides and autonomously attacks its former allies.  

	Characteristics :  
- Channeled Charm : If the charm is channeled, damaging or interrupting the caster will shorten or break the effect.  
- No Damage Breaks : The charm effect persists on the target even when it takes damage.  
- Maximum Duration in PvP : While **Charm** is not inherently used in PvP, certain items mimic its effects. Against players, "Charm" lasts a maximum of 8 seconds, 
regardless of the listed duration.  
- Cancellation :  
  - Cannot be cured. 
  - Can be canceled by stunning or moving the caster.  

	Immunity :  
- Pets & Mounts :  
  - All pets (except "Hunter Pets") and all mounts, including horses, are immune to charm effects.
