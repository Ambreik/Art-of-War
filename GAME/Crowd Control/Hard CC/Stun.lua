		Overview :  
	Effect :  
  - "Stun" prevents the target from moving or performing most actions, including basic attacks and skills.  
  - Unlike other CC effects (like "snare" or "root"), "stuns" disable all actions, making it a highly effective CC.  
  - Duration : Stuns are usually short-lived due to their power.  
  - Damage and Break Mechanism :  
    - "Stuns" do not break when the target takes damage (unlike "disorient" or "incapacitate").  
    - Certain abilities counter or reduce the duration of "stuns".  
    - The "Immune against Blackouts" bonus can completely block "stuns".  
    - The "Defence against Blackouts" bonus has a 30% chance to block "stuns" when added to shields.  

	Raid and Dungeon Bosses :  
  - Most raid bosses, elite mobs, and world bosses or notorious monsters are permanently immune to stun effects.  
  - Special skills are designed to increase damage against targets that are immune to CC like "stuns".
