			Knockback (Hard Crowd Control)

	Type : "Knockback" (or "Punting") is a "Hard Crowd Control" (Hard CC) effect designed to displace enemies by physically moving them away from the 
caster.  

---

	Mechanics :  
- Effect :  
  - Knocks an enemy away from the caster or in the same direction as the caster's motion.  
  - Distance varies from minor displacement to significant distances, potentially lifting enemies slightly into the air but does not dismount mounted 
players.  
  - Temporarily interrupts casting and stops enemy actions without applying a lasting stun.  

	Duration :  
  - Instantaneous with no extended duration.  

	Cure :  
  - Knockback effects cannot be cured by any means.  

	PvP :  
  - Not usable in PvP, reserved for PvM (monsters, bosses, and NPCs).  

	UI :  
  - Knockback effects have a unique "UI icon" displayed when active.  

	Comparison with Pushback :  
  - "Knockback" involves moving enemies away and lifting them slightly off the ground.  
  - "Pushback" (a player-usable CC) pushes enemies back without lifting or displacing them significantly.

	Effects of Knockback :  
- Disables Movement : Prevents targets from moving while being displaced.  
- Disables Basic Attacks : Stops auto-attacks during displacement.  
- Disables Skills : Prevents all skill usage during motion.  
- Interrupts Casting : Cancels skills in progress, including "blink" and "charge" abilities, but not channeling skills.  
- Resilience : Knockback distance is unaffected by the target's **Resilience** stats.
