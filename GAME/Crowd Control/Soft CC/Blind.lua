			Blind (Crowd Control)

	Type : "Blind" is a "Soft Crowd Control" (Soft CC) effect that blinds the target, causing them to miss their "Basic Attacks" for the duration. It is comparable to
attacking a target that is able to "Dodge" or "Block", though not mechanically similar. When "Blinded", "Basic Attacks" will miss, failing to deal damage or trigger 
any "On-hit" effects, except for some empowered basic attacks. However, "Blind" does not prevent the target from declaring an attack, unlike "Disarm", and it does not
interrupt any actions.

	Mechanics:
- Missed Basic Attacks : Blinded targets will miss their basic attacks, which means they cannot deal damage or apply "On-hit" effects.
- Ranged Role : For ranged characters, attacks will hit if the projectile was fired before the "Blind" effect. Similarly, melee attacks will miss only if they are 
declared while "Blinded".
- Duration : The "Blind" effect lasts 4 to 8 seconds.
- No Cure : "Blind" cannot be cured directly.
- UI Icon : "Blind" have a "status icon" to indicate its active state.

	Blind Effects:
- Disables Basic Attacks : The target will miss basic attacks, not dealing damage or triggering "On-hit" effects.
- Reduced Duration by Resilience : The duration of the "Blind" effect can be reduced by "Resilience".
