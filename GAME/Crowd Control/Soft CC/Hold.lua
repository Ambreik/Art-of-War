			Hold (Crowd Control)

	Type : "Hold" (also known as "Immobilize") is a type of "Soft Crowd Control" (Soft CC) effect. It prevents the character from moving, essentially locking the 
target in place. While under this effect, the target is still able to use "Basic Attacks" and most skills, with the exception of "Blink" or "Charge" skills. This CC 
is commonly used in "Dungeon/Instance Runs (DIR)" where it is applied in confined spaces such as rooms. Boss minions may use this effect to prevent characters from 
escaping a series of attacks, typically before the main boss executes a large assault.

	Mechanics:
- Duration : The duration of the "Hold" effect ranges from 4 to 8 seconds.
- Impact : The character is prevented from moving but can still perform other actions like basic attacks or using most skills, except those that rely on movement such
as "Blink" or "Charge" skills.
- Cure : This "Soft CC" cannot be cured and lasts the full duration unless the effect is removed by another mechanic.
- UI Icon : "Hold" has a "status icon" to indicate its active state.

	Hold Effects:
- Disables Movement : The target cannot move for the duration of the effect.
- Disables Basic Attacks : Basic attacks are still available.
- Disables Blink/Charge Skills : Movement-based abilities like "Blink" or "Charge" are rendered inactive during the effect.
- Resilience Impact : The duration can be reduced by "Resilience" bonuses.

	Companion:
- Companion Healer : (Could be added for additional context on companions)
