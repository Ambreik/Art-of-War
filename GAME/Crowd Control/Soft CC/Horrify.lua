			Horrify (Crowd Control)

	Type : "Horrify" effects are a form of "Soft Crowd Control" (Soft CC). These effects may "root" the target or cause them to run in a random direction. While under
the effect of Horrify, the target is prevented from taking most actions for the duration.This is similar to the "Fear" effect but with slight differences in behavior.

	Mechanics:
- Duration : The duration of the Horrify effect is variable, but it may be broken prematurely if the target takes damage.
- Effect : The target is either rooted in place or forced to run in a random direction, depending on the specific implementation of the effect.
- Action Impact : While affected by Horrify, the target is unable to perform most actions:
  - Movement is either rooted or random.
  - Basic Attacks cannot be performed.
  - Skills are unavailable.
  - Interrupts Skills : Excludes channeling abilities (which are not interrupted).
  
	UI Icon : Horrify has a "status icon" to indicate when the effect is active.
