			Slowdown (Crowd Control)

	Type : Slowdown effects are a form of "Crowd Control" that reduce a target's movement speed, making it harder for them to maneuver effectively in combat.

	Types of Slowdown:
1. Area-based Slowdown : This is applied in a specific area or zone, affecting all targets within the area.
2. Debuff-based Slowdown : This is applied to individual targets, reducing their speed directly.

	Usage:
- "Slowdown" is highly effective for ranged classes fighting melee enemies, allowing them to kite and maintain distance. On the other hand, melee classes can use Slowdown to keep ranged enemies from escaping.
- It is also useful for preventing enemies from fleeing to safety or summoning reinforcements, especially in dungeons or instances.

	Mechanics:
- Speed Reduction : Slowdown effects are typically applied as a percentage reduction in movement speed. The most common reduction for low-ranked monsters is 20%.
- High-ranked monsters or those in dungeons/instances can apply up to 80% slowdown.
- The duration of Slowdown effects is random, ranging from 5 seconds to 1 minute.
- Stacking : 
  - Slowdown can stack up to 20 times.
  - If multiple Slowdowns are applied, only those with the same effect will stack. A higher percentage of Slowdown will replace the lower stack.

	UI Icon : Slowdown has a "status icon" for easy tracking in combat.
