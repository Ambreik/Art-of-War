			Incapacitate (Crowd Control)

	Type : Incapacitate (also known as "Knockout") is a form of crowd control that renders a target unable to move or act for a short period of time. Unlike Stun, 
"Incapacitate" effects always break upon "taking damage, while Stun effects do not. "Incapacitate" effects are often harder to break free from. It differs from "Disorient" effects in that the target is stationary rather than wandering aimlessly.
