			Disarm (Crowd Control)

	Type : "Disarm" is a type of "Soft Crowd Control" (Soft CC) effect primarily used in "PvM" (Player vs. Monster) combat. When a target is disarmed, they are 
prevented from using basic attacks and are forced to drop their weapon. If the target attempts to use the basic attack through the attack button, they will receive 
the prompt: 
[System Message] : "Being disarmed, cannot cast basic attack." 

	If the character's inventory is full, the weapon will be moved to their "Carry Pet" inventory. If the character does not have a pet, the weapon will be 
dropped on the ground and remain there for a maximum of 3 minutes. Retrieving the dropped weapon will end the "Disarm" effect.

	Mechanics:
- Duration : The "Disarm" effect lasts until the weapon is either retrieved by the player or the duration ends.
- Weapon Drop : The character's weapon will be dropped in the following manner:
  - If the inventory is full, the weapon will be moved to the "Carry Pet" inventory.
  - If there is no "Carry Pet", the weapon will be dropped on the ground for up to 3 minutes.
- Cure : The only way to immediately end the "Disarm" effect is by retrieving the dropped weapon.
- UI Icon : "Disarm" has a "status icon" to indicate its active state.

	Disarm Effects:
- Disables Basic Attacks : The target cannot use basic attacks for the duration of the effect.
- Ignores Resilience : "Disarm" is not affected by "Resilience" and remains in effect for the full duration.
- Control Immunity : The effect can be prevented by "control immunity".
- Weapon Retrieval : The effect ends immediately when the weapon is retrieved.
