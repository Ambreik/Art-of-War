			Soft CCs (Crowd Control)

	Type : Soft CCs are a type of "Crowd Control" that disables or hinders the target, leaving them vulnerable but still capable of attacking or using certain 
abilities.

	Description :
- Soft CCs place the target in a tricky situation, often rendering them defenseless, unable to attack, or unable to provide support during the duration.
- Unlike harder CCs that may prevent all actions (e.g., stuns), "Soft CCs" still allow the target to perform some actions, though they will typically be at a disadvantage.
  
	Duration :
- Soft CCs have a base duration of 4 seconds.
- Stacking : If the same Soft CC is applied to the same target again before the cooldown of the first application is over, the duration can stack. Stacking is possible up to 5 times.
  
	Cure :
- Soft CCs can be cured by the following abilities:
  - Shaman Healer : [Cure]
  - Warlock Sorcerer : [Burning Spirit]

	Additional Notes :
- Soft CCs are designed to create strategic openings in combat by leaving the target vulnerable without fully disabling them. These can be used in conjunction with other CCs or debuffs to increase the difficulty of combat for the affected target.
