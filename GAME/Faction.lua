## **Section II: Major Racial Factions (Playable Race Extensions)**

* When a player creates a character, they must select **either Knight (Dendera)** or **Pindar (Zonen)**.
* Once chosen, players cannot create characters aligned with the opposite major faction (same system as WoW faction-lock).

**Racial Faction Extensions:**

* **Dendera (Knights):** Includes the **Vampire** racial faction, featuring playable vampire characters and NPCs in *Dravenhold* and *Forest of Trevale*.
* **Zonen (Pindars):** Includes the **Werewolf** racial faction, featuring playable werewolf characters and NPCs in *Dreadhollow Fortress* and *Arsshis Woods*.
* **Alaban (Outlaws):** Consists of characters who defected from Knights or Pindars; these players maintain partial allegiance to their origin faction while acting independently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Aarong Forest Specifics:**

  * Divided between Knight and Pindar influences, both neutral toward each other in this zone.
  * Home to the five minor factions (Dwarves, Gnomes, Trolls, Wise Humans, Faity Elves).
  * Emissaries of each faction reside in **Ancient City of Sankis**, the regional hub.
  * Local NPC communities (guards, merchants, vendors) remain neutral to all factions and players.

* Other Outland regions follow similar structures — neutral settlements, REP-enabled NPCs, and distinct environmental challenges.
