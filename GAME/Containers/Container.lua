			Container  

	A "Container" is a general term for any item or object in the game that holds or stores other items. Containers play a vital role in organizing and managing 
inventory within the game world.

		Types of Containers :

1. "Bags" :  
	- Description : Bags are equippable items that players can use to store other items. They serve as the primary method for managing inventory and expanding a player's carrying capacity. Players can place any items in these bags at will, as long as they have enough space.  
	- Example : A small backpack, a large satchel, or a fancy pouch.

2. Lootable Objects :  
	- Description : These are objects scattered throughout the world that players can loot. Once looted, these objects disappear, and can no longer be accessed.  
		- Chest Objects : Found around the world, such as footlockers, baskets, and various chests. Some of these objects may require a key to open, making them 
locked lootables.  
		- Ore Veins and Herb Objects : These require specific "Mining" or "Herbalism" skills to harvest. Ore veins and herb plants can be looted for materials 
once the proper skill level is achieved.

3. "Lootable Items" :  
   - Description : Lootable items are special containers that players gain in various ways. Like lootable objects, once these containers are emptied, they 
disappear.  
		- "Lockboxes" : These are locked containers often found as loot, and they require either a key or a specific skill (like Lockpicking) to open.  
		- "Junkboxes" : Acquired through pickpocketing, junkboxes are always locked and must be opened using the proper skills or NPC assistance 
(e.g., "Zarian, Master of Lockpicking").  
		- "Reward Bags" : These are special loot containers received as rewards, such as the "Mysterious Carrier" from a rare quest. They contain items specific to 
the quest's reward.

4. "Single-Purpose Containers" :  
	- Description : These containers serve a specific purpose, holding only one type of item. Instead of presenting a list of contents to choose from, players 
automatically receive one of the items contained within.  
	- Example : A "Pill Bottle" that always contains a single healing potion or a "Treasure Chest" that holds a single gem.

5. "Chests" :  
	- Description : A type of lootable object or storage container. Chests can appear in various locations across the game world, including dungeons, houses, and 
outdoor areas. Some chests may require keys to open and may contain valuable loot or other types of rewards.
