			Chest  

	A "Chest" is a world object in the "World Game" that can be found throughout the game world, typically near humanoid encampments, ruins, or scattered in areas 
of interest. These chests are loot containers that hold a variety of items, with contents determined by their level and location.

	General Information :
- "Lootable Objects" : Chests are world objects that can be looted for various items such as tradeskill materials, food, drink, and occasionally equipment. The loot
quality and quantity depend on the chestâ€™s level.
- "Opening Chests" : Opening a chest requires time and cannot be done while in combat. Some chests may be locked and require special actions to open, such as a key,
explosive charges crafted by "Outlaws", or the "Lockpicking" ability.  
- "Aggro Risk" : Opening chests will often draw the attention of nearby hostile creatures, potentially causing combat if players are not prepared.
- "Loot Rules" : Chests do not follow group loot rules, meaning the player who opens the chest will keep any loot found, similar to loot drops from mobs.
- "Loot Expiration" : If a chest is opened but not looted, it will disappear after 5 minutes.
