			Lockbox  

	A "Lockbox" is a type of container found in the "World Game", typically as an item drop rather than a fixed world object like chests. Lockboxes are secure 
containers that require "Lockpicking" or a corresponding key to open. These boxes often contain valuable or unique items, such as crafting materials, gold, and 
occasionally rare quest-related items.

	General Information :
- Looted Item : Lockboxes are often looted from monsters across various levels in the game. They are usually found as drops from defeated enemies rather than being 
fixed in the environment like chests.
- Opening Lockboxes : To open a lockbox, players must either use a corresponding key or have a "Universal Key" crafted by "Dorin - Key Master". Each type of 
lockbox requires its own key, such as a "Copper Key" or "Bronze Key". Keys are typically dropped by the same monsters that drop the lockboxes.
- Lockpicking : Players can attempt to open lockboxes using their "Lockpicking" skill. The skill requirement varies depending on the lockbox type.
- Loot : The contents of a lockbox are generally composed of gold, junk items (which can be sold for silver), and sometimes more valuable items such as crafting 
materials or rare quest-related items like the "Letter of No One".

	Loot and Special Items :

- General Loot : Most lockboxes contain common items such as gold and low-value "junk" items, which can be sold to vendors for silver.  
- Special Items : Each lockbox has a chance to contain unique items that can be used for specific purposes such as "Blacksmithing", "Crafting", or for quests.

		Key and Drop Information :
- Drop Rate : Lockboxes typically drop alongside the corresponding key from the same monsters that drop the box. For example, "Copper Lockboxes" drop from certain mobs and can be opened using a "Copper Key", which also drops from those same monsters.
- Key Crafting : If players dont have the specific key, they can use a "Universal Key" crafted by "Dorin - Key Master" to open any lockbox.

	Lockboxes are a rewarding type of loot container in the "World Game", providing players with not only the potential for valuable crafting materials and gold but
also rare items that can lead to special quests. However, opening lockboxes requires patience and skill, especially for those that require high-level "Lockpicking".
