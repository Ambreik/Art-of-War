			Junkbox

	"Junkboxes" are lootable containers that can be obtained by "Outlaws" through the "Pickpocketing" skill, which allows them to steal from monsters or, in some 
cases, from players. The type and quality of the "Junkbox" (and the loot inside) improve based on the level of the monster from which it is stolen. Junkboxes can be
opened without the need for a key, and are an important part of the "Outlaw" experience in the "World Game".

	Types of Junkboxes :
- "Junkbox" : Pickpocketed from monsters in the level range ~20-60.
- "Sturdy Box" : Pickpocketed from monsters in the level range ~60-80.
- "Heavy Box" : Pickpocketed from monsters in the level range ~80-90.
- "Shiny Box" : Pickpocketed from monsters in the level range ~100-120.

	The "Junkbox" will usually contain only small amounts of copper or mundane vendor trash, though it might occasionally hold raw gems or useful items like 
"Healing Potions" or "Poisons". As the level of the monster increases, the quality and quantity of loot improve, with "Sturdy Boxes" containing more valuable items 
like "rogue poisons", "ability materials", and "Healing Potions".

	Skill Progression :
To unlock higher-tier Junkboxes and improve pickpocketing speed, the "Outlaw" must pickpocket a certain number of successful boxes:

- "Novice" : 50 successful pickpocketings (Unlocks Junkbox).
- "Master" : 300 successful pickpocketings (Unlocks Sturdy Box).
- "Expert" : 1000 successful pickpocketings (Unlocks Heavy Box).
- "Artisan" : 5000 successful pickpocketings (Unlocks Shiny Box).

	Each skill level also reduces the chance of being noticed while pickpocketing:

- "Novice" : 90% chance of being noticed.
- "Master" : 80% chance of being noticed.
- "Expert" : 50% chance of being noticed.
- "Artisan" : 5% chance of being noticed.

	Opening Junkboxes :
All Junkboxes require a special NPC to open them: "Zarian", the "Master of Lockpicking", located in "Alabam" (outside the main village). 

	Stacking :
- "Junkboxes" and "Sturdy Boxes" can be stacked up to "200".
- "Heavy Boxes" can also stack up to "200".
- "Shiny Boxes" can stack up to "500". 

This system encourages outlaws to specialize in pickpocketing and gain access to progressively more valuable loot as they improve their skills.
