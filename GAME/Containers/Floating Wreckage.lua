			Floating Wreckage  

	Description : Floating wreckage consists of the remnants of unfortunate ships that have met disastrous fates at sea. These pieces of wreckage drift across the 
ocean for months, eventually washing up on the shores of coastal regions. While these are the result of loss, they offer opportunities for those brave enough to 
salvage what remains. 

	Function : Floating wreckage spawns in circular formations in the water, resembling schools of fish. However, the wreckage is harder to spot because the objects 
form an overlapping circle, and players must use fishing skills to "fish" the wreckage for various items. The spawn locations mirror those of schools of fish and are 
often found around islands, especially in the "Middlean Islands" region, typically in coastal areas.

	Spawn Frequency : Floating wreckage can spawn randomly between 5 minutes and 2 hours, depending on the specific island and region. On "Sundays" and "Mondays", the
spawn timer resets, and up to 21 wreckage pieces can appear, although the exact number varies based on the day. Some islands may have fewer or more wreckage depending
on their proximity to the mainland or other factors.

	Fishing Process : Players must fish within the circular spawn area. If the fishing bobber lands within the circle, successful fishing yields watertight chests. 
These chests can contain a variety of items, much like land-based chest spawns.

	Common Contents of Floating Wreckage :
- "Trunks" : The most common loot obtained from wreckage, with the quality of loot inside depending on the level of the area. Trunks can contain:
  - "Potions" (Healing, Mana)
  - "Bags"
  - "Money"
  - "Blacksmithing materials" (pieces for crafting)
  - "Fishing rod components" (pieces to upgrade or create fishing rods)
  
- "Bloated Fish" : Occasionally, wreckage will contain "bloated fish", which can be opened to reveal:
  - "Gems"
  - "Pearls"
  
- "Rum Potions : Some wreckage may also drop "Rum Potions", which have a timer before they spoil and become useless.

	Known Locations :
- "Middlean Islands" : Floating wreckage spawns primarily in the coastal areas around islands in the "Middlean Islands". These wreckage areas are located at specific,
consistent points around the islands, but the spawn times are random. Players can usually find 5-21 wreckage pieces per island, with more frequent spawns on "Sundays"
and "Mondays".
