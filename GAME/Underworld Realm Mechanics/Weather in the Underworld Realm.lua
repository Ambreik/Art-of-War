			Weather in the Underworld Realm

1. "Constant Gloom and Heavy Shadows": Shadows seem to breathe and move as if alive, casting an oppressive gloom over the landscape. Sunlight doesn’t reach this 
realm, so an unnatural, dim glow from unknown sources provides minimal light, deepening the eerie atmosphere.

2. "Soul Storms": Occasionally, the skies twist with ghostly clouds, and "Soul Storms" occur. These storms bring spectral winds filled with whispers and faint, 
sorrowful cries. The storm's chill slows player movement, and visibility drops as swirling shadows obscure vision. Players caught in these storms may experience 
"Spirit Fracture", a temporary debuff reducing stamina and health regeneration.

3. "Eternal Mist": The realm is often shrouded in a thick, low-lying mist, seeping from cracks in the ground and drifting over rivers. The mist clings to everything, 
muffling sounds and giving the environment an otherworldly feel. This "Veil Mist" drains stamina gradually, forcing players to conserve their energy, especially in combat.

4. "Spectral Rains": Rare but powerful, spectral rains leave pools of shimmering ectoplasm that temporarily disable visibility. These rains have a 20% chance to 
attract shadowy creatures drawn to the ectoplasmic pools, adding danger as players navigate slick, haunted ground. 

5. "Flame Flares": Spontaneous eruptions of ethereal fire, these intense flares appear near cursed locations or areas marked with "Soul Anchors". Though they burn 
without warmth, these flames do minor damage over time and release short-lived apparitions that chase players.

6. "Shifting Skies": The realm’s skies fluctuate unpredictably. At times, a faint crimson or sickly green glow breaks through the darkness, while at others, spectral 
constellations seem to shine before fading away. This unpredictable sky keeps players on edge, adding to the disorienting experience in the Underworld Realm.

7. "Memory Drifts": Rare occurrences when fragmented memories from lost souls drift through the air like ghostly apparitions. Players exposed to these drifts may 
briefly experience visions or unsettling audio cues from the past, contributing to the immersive atmosphere.
