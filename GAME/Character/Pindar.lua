			Pindars: Faction Overview

	Origin : The Pindars are a powerful faction originating from the continent of "Zonen", located on the right side of the World Map. They are led by "Kellan", the
first Pindar, who is immortal due to his consumption of the "Water of Immortality". Kellan, the brother-in-law of "King Aric Bolemir" and brother of "Queen Elara",
was once a warrior who sought the power to protect his kingdom and loved ones, ultimately drinking from the Immortality Water. This act granted him eternal life, 
enabling him to lead the Pindars for centuries.

	The Pindars homeland is marked by a blend of rugged terrains and fertile lands, including the "Zonen Fortress", "Arsshis Woods", "South Valley", and 
"Ash Isle", creating a diverse landscape with rich history and culture. The Pindars, though less technologically advanced than the Knights, rely on their fierce 
combat prowess, mastery of magic, and survival instincts to maintain their dominance.
