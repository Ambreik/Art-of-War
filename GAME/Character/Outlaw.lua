			Outlaws Faction Overview

	In the World Game, "Outlaws" are unique players who have chosen to betray their original factions, driven by a mix of mystery, ambition, and allure for hidden 
power. Unlike regular players, they operate from the hidden city of "Abalan" and gain access to exclusive skills, abilities, and a rebellious story arc that deepens
their gameplay experience and sets them apart in the game world.

		Becoming an Outlaw: The Path of Betrayal

	The journey to become an Outlaw begins with a mysterious NPC known as "Mr. Tom", who roams the main city of each faction on the starting continents. He seeks 
out players who are "level 32 or higher" and entices them with tales of secrets, lost knowledge, and promises of a long-forgotten treasure. Players are led through 
a series of challenging quests, which gradually reveal a different side of the game’s story, hinting at the hidden agendas of the player’s original faction.
	Upon completing the final stages of the questline, players face a critical choice: to remain loyal to their faction or to accept Mr. Tom's offer and join the 
Outlaws. Those who choose to follow him undergo a faction betrayal, transforming them into Outlaws. This change resets their faction "GRADE" to zero, which 
continues to slowly decrease with prolonged PvE combat.

		The Hidden City of Abalan

	Once an Outlaw, players gain the ability to teleport to their new city, "Abalan", a concealed settlement known only to members of this faction. Abalan's 
location is unknown to most of the game’s world, with information about it mentioned only in ancient texts hidden in the Grand Library of the Capital City in 
Middlean Islands. However, many of these references have been destroyed or censored by the agents loyal to Mr. Tom, ensuring that only the Outlaws know its exact 
location.
	Abalan serves as a sanctuary, a place where Outlaws can hone their unique skills, receive quests, and access resources unavailable to players from other 
factions. Here, they discover a rich lore centered on their faction’s rebellious cause and their leaders' secrets, and they gain access to powerful items and 
abilities exclusive to Outlaws.

- "Skill Recoloration" : Outlaw abilities display in unique colors, making it visually clear to others that they are no longer loyal to their original faction.

		The Power of Poison

	Outlaws can create and refine "Pure Poison", a potent material extracted from specific monsters in Abalan. This resource allows Outlaws to add a 
"Chance to Poison" effect to their equipment, which provides a chance to inflict poison damage on enemies with each hit. This unique bonus can only be crafted by 
Outlaws and requires a specialized process, making it both rare and highly sought after in PvP battles.

		Role and Reputation in the World Game

	Outlaws are a feared and respected force in the World Game, known for their ruthlessness, skill, and access to forbidden techniques. Their decision to betray 
their factions carries social and gameplay consequences, and their allegiance to Abalan creates a third faction dynamic in the game. Outlaws embody a sense of 
rebellion and independence, offering players a distinct path that emphasizes both power and isolation. This path caters to players seeking a unique gameplay 
experience that defies the norms of loyalty and heroism.

		In Summary

	The "Outlaw faction" offers a complex and richly developed alternate path for players. By choosing betrayal, players unlock the hidden city of Abalan, acquire 
exclusive abilities, and master the rare art of Poison Manipulation, marking them as formidable and mysterious figures in the game. Outlaws bring a new layer of 
conflict to the World Game, with their distinct advantages, unique skills, and an underground reputation that challenges the conventional factional loyalties.
