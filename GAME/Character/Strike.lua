			Strike Skill Overview

	The "Strike" skill is a unique ability that all classes can learn upon reaching "level 35", available from their "Class Teacher" in the 
"Middlean Islands". This skill is designed to be a "counterspell" that provides various effects depending on the class, offering a tactical advantage 
in combat.

	Strike Characteristics :
- "Activation" : "Instant Cast" and "No Mana Cost" – The skill can be used at any time, regardless of the global cooldown,as long as it is successful.
- "Effect" : The Strike produces a sparkling effect upon hitting the target, and this effect cannot be dispelled.
- "Mana/Energy/Focus/Rage Cost" : There is no resource cost associated with using this ability.
- "Damage" : Strike generally does not deal damage, instead offering utility and status effects that can disable or hinder enemies.

		Improvement of Strike

	Once learned, the "Strike" skill can be further improved through a "mini-chain quest" system. This improvement is done in three stages, each of 
which has specific requirements and rewards that enhance the effectiveness of the skill.

	Stage 1 : "Yellow"
- Quest Requirement : Complete a series of mini-chain quests.
	- For each quest completed, the player gains "1 point".
	- At the end of the chain, the player will have "5 points".
- Outcome : This stage helps unlock the foundational aspects of the Strike skill.

	Stage 2 : "Orange"
- Quest Requirement : Perform "140 successful strikes" on enemies.
	- This can be completed by attacking "enemy factions", or players can engage in "Arena" battles to fulfill this requirement.
- Outcome : Completing this stage further improves the skill and brings it closer to its next power-up.

	Stage 3 : "Red"
- Requirement : Read "10 perchants" (magical scrolls) that enhance the skill.
	- Perchant Reading : The reading can fail, but for each successful reading, the player gains "1 point" toward improving the Strike skill.
- Outcome : This stage grants the final improvements and introduces class-specific side effects to the Strike ability.

		Side Effects of Strike (Class-Specific)

	With each improvement stage, "side effects" are added to the Strike skill, offering additional utility. These effects are "class-specific" and 
contribute to the strategic use of the skill.

1. Mini Stun : Duration: "1 second" – Temporarily incapacitates the target.
2. Mini Silence : Duration: "1 second" – Prevents the target from casting spells or using abilities.
3. Mini Slowdown : Duration: "2 seconds" – Reduces the movement speed of the target.
4. Mini Taunt : Duration: "1 second" – Forces the target to focus their attacks on the player who used the Strike.

	These effects enhance the versatility of the Strike skill, allowing players to control the pace of battle and counter various threats depending on
their character’s class and playstyle.
