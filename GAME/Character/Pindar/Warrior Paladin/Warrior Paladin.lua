	Skill :
*Purify : Dispels harmful effects on himself/herself and have a chance to cure most of the DoTs effects.
*Stump : rise your spear and jumping, hit the ground hard with it creading a shockwave around. All enemies that are in your radius are stunned and "Knockdown". The 
higher the skill rank is , the faster the action is performed and the "Stun" effect chance and duration is increased. Also the radius increase.
*Call for Battle : hit the ground with spear and shout loud forcing the monsters in the skill radius to attack for 5 seconds and also generates enough threat so that 
matches the current top entry in the mob's aggro list. Taunt is instant-cast, does not trigger the global cooldown, costs no mana and has an 8 second cooldown. Can 
also be used in PvP and can taunt only the closest target for 1 second only. Radius of skill is big around the character.
