	Skill : 
*Enchanted Armour : reflective damage, cause high treat for surrounding monsters.
*Fear : Weakens the enemies abilities and also put all surrounding monsters in an ignoring stance for them, removing all aggro or treat from their "Aggro List".
*Burning Spirit : Cures harmful effects on the friendly target, removing all Magic, Curse, and most DoTs effects.
*Burning Flame : send a sphere to the designed area creating a blast of fire dealing massive damage in its radius. Also have a chance to affect with "Confusion" when
used in PvM. The higher the skill rank is , the faster the action is performed and the "Confusion" effect chance and duration is increased. Also the radius increase.
*Taunt Call : Shout loud which forces the monsters in the skill radius to attack for 3 seconds and also generates enough threat so that matches the current top entry 
in the mob's aggro list. Taunt is instant-cast, does not trigger the global cooldown, costs no mana and has an 8 second cooldown. Can also be used in PvP and can 
taunt only the closest target. Radius of skill is small around the character.
