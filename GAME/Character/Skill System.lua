			Skill System


		Skill Unlocking and Level-Based Progression
- Core Skill Unlocking : Each class starts with foundational core skills unlocked at lower levels, providing essential abilities. These skills span 
categories like offense, defense, support, or utility, ensuring each class has a balanced skill set to build upon. Core skills help define a class’s 
role in combat, granting access to fundamental attacks, defensive abilities, or supportive actions early in the game.
- Incremental Advanced Skills : As players level up, they unlock Advanced Skills incrementally up to level 60 in "Expansion I". These abilities 
enhance each class’s role further, often introducing more powerful abilities or unique mechanics that enable versatility and specialization. Skills in
later expansions (up to level 120) will continue to expand on this system, keeping progression fresh and dynamic.

		Skill Unlocking and Trainer Visits
- Class Trainer Requirements : Players periodically return to their "Class Trainer" at specific levels to unlock new skills in each category 
(offensive, defensive,support/utility). These visits give players access to new abilities and allow them to choose skills that best match their 
playstyle.
- Skill Unlock Levels and Categories :
	- Offensive Skills : New offensive skills are unlocked at levels 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45.
	- Defensive Skills : Players unlock defensive abilities at levels 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.
	- Support/Utility Skills : Unlocked at levels 8, 18, 28, 38, and 48.

		Skill Selection Limitations
- Skill Choice and Customization :
	- Offensive Skills : 
		- DPS Classes : Can choose a maximum of 4 offensive skills from a pool of 5.
		- Support Classes : Limited to 3 offensive skills, ensuring they maintain a focus on utility or support rather than pure damage output.
	- Defensive Skills :
		- Support/Tank Classes : Can select up to 4 defensive skills from the pool of 5 to support their resilience and group protection roles.
		- DPS Classes : Limited to 2 defensive skills, maintaining a balance between offense and survivability.
	- Support/Utility Skills :
		- Buffer/Sorcerer Classes : Can choose up to 4 support/utility skills from a pool of 5 to maximize their team-support capabilities.
		- Tanky Classes : Allowed up to 3 support/utility skills to bolster their role in group protection.
		- DPS Classes : Limited to 2 support/utility skills, encouraging a primary focus on offense.
	
	Each class ends up with a "total of 10 skills", customized according to their preferred role within PvE and PvP settings.
	Players must return to the trainer to receive these skills at designated levels, encouraging players to plan their builds and select skills based 
on the evolving needs of their roles.

		Skill Advancement through Competency Books and Sigil Stones
- "Competency Books" : Once a skill is unlocked, players use "Competency Books" to upgrade skills to "Master level". Each skill needs 10 successful 
book reads, with a 50% success rate per book. Failed readings trigger a 2-hour cooldown, while successful reads allow immediate progression. 
Competency Books are primarily obtained from outdoor mini-bosses, Rare Bosses, and other non-dungeon content or "Mystic Stones".
- "Sigil Stones" : After reaching "Master", skills advance from "Master" to "Grand Master" or "G", through "Sigil Stones". These stones require 
careful usage, with each skill needing 10-25 "Sigil Stones" for full mastery. Failed attempts result in a 12-hour cooldown, while successful 
absorptions incur no delay, allowing players to try the next stone immediately. "Sigil Stones" are rare drops found in dungeon bosses, world bosses, 
and specific event chests.
- "Perfect Skill Enchantment" : Reaching "Grand Master" allows players to further enhance their skills with "Perfect Skill Enchantment". Each class 
uses unique resources to push their abilities beyond "Grand Master" :
	- "Mana Orbs" (Shamans): Collected from mana-rich areas or bosses, these orbs enchant spells to increase their range, potency, or effect duration.
	- "Rage Points" (Warriors - Knights & Pindars): Built through sustained combat, Rage Points amplify warrior abilities, improving both damage and 
defense.
	- "Blood Orbs" (Vampires & Werewolves): Blood Orbs, collected during fights, empower Vampires and Werewolves, increasing AoE range, lifesteal 
effects, or defensive stances.
	- "Life Energy" (Warlocks): Warlocks absorb Life Energy from fallen enemies, enhancing dark spells with greater AoE, DoT effects, or shield 
enhancements.
    - "Combo Points" (Ninjas - Assassins/Archers & Rogues/Ragers): Combo Points stack up with sequential strikes, amplifying skill power, speed, and 
critical chance for potent finishing moves.

		Skill Mastery Path
- Skill Progression Levels :
	- "Core Skills" (Level Unlocked): Core abilities with fundamental offensive, defensive, or supportive actions.
	- "Master Skills" : Enhanced versions of core skills gained through Competency Books, improving damage, cooldown reduction, and effectiveness.
	- "Grand Master Skills" : Achieved by absorbing Sigil Stones, these are the high-level versions of each skill, with significant upgrades to power,
range, or special effects.
	- "Perfect Master Skills" : With "Perfect Skill Enchantment", these skills reach their peak power and visual grandeur, providing unique 
enhancements tied to each class’s resource mechanic.

		Visual and Utility Augmentation
- Visual Progression : Skills visually evolve as they rank up, distinguishing beginner skills from higher mastery. Master skills have refined visual 
effects, while "Grand Master" and "Perfect Master" skills showcase powerful animations, vibrant effects, and sound designs that signify mastery.
- Utility Augmentation : Skill mastery not only increases base stats like damage or range but also improves utility elements (e.g., larger AoE for crowd control, increased buff duration, or faster effect initiation). Skills gain added functions, such as debuffing enemies, shielding allies, or 
improving resource generation.

		Skill Categories and Core Skill Distribution
	Each class benefits from having essential core skills early on. These skills define their primary combat role, with gradual access to more 
powerful abilities:
	- "Offensive Skills" : Damage-dealing abilities for DPS roles, focusing on consistent, moderate-damage attacks at low levels, with stronger burst 
or AoE options later.
	- "Defensive Skills" : Tank skills for mitigating damage, taunting enemies, and temporarily increasing resilience.
	- "Support/Utility Skills" : Abilities focused on buffing allies, healing, or improving movement. Support skills are short cooldowns early on and 
gain more impactful effects as they progress.
	- "Advanced Skills" : As players progress toward level 60, these skills add further depth, with resource mechanics providing unique advantages and
situational power spikes.

		Ultimate Skill Options at Level 70
- Unlocking the Ultimate Skill : At level 70, players receive the opportunity to select an "Ultimate Skill" from three available types: Offensive, 
Defensive, or Buff. Each Ultimate Skill provides a powerful advantage tailored to the player’s preferred playstyle.
	- Choice and Customization : Players can choose only one "Ultimate Skill" type. Within each category, there are two skill options, allowing 
players to tailor this powerful ability further to their needs.
- Impact and Usage : These skills represent the pinnacle of a player’s abilities, designed with massive effects in PvPvM scenarios. With long 
cooldowns (20 to 40 minutes), they can only be used strategically, offering players temporary but decisive advantages that can swing the tide in 
intense battles.

		Level 100 Skill Choice and Extra Skill Mechanic
- Second Ultimate Skill Selection : At level 100, players can select a second Ultimate Skill from the remaining categories. There is a 50% chance of 
unlocking a bonus skill as an additional benefit, rewarding lucky players with an extra skill in PvE or PvP scenarios.
- Cooldown and Utility : The cooldown and magnitude of these second skills are on par with the initial Ultimate Skill, making them valuable assets 
with high-impact potential for critical moments in PvPvM encounters.

		Ultimate Skill Mechanics: Fury Charge System

	1. Fury Charge Accumulation :
- Maximum Pool : Fury has a maximum pool of 100 points, representing the peak intensity warriors can harness.
- Regeneration Through Combat : Fury slowly regenerates during combat as warriors take and deal damage. The regeneration rate may vary depending on 
combat engagement, with faster regen during intense battles.
- Equipment Modifiers : Certain equipment, especially relics or rare armor, can increase the maximum Fury pool by +5 points, extending the threshold 
to 105. An alternative equipment bonus may boost Fury regeneration rate, helping players build up charges faster.

	2. Using Fury for Ultimate Skills :
- Activation Threshold : Players must have a minimum of 80 Fury Charges to activate the Ultimate Skill, with greater power achieved if it’s fully charged at 100.
	- Skill Types and Selection : At level 70, players choose one of three Ultimate Skills: Offensive, Defensive, or Support.
		- Offensive Ultimate : High-damage skill with an Area of Effect (AoE) impact or single-target burst, ideal for dealing devastating damage.
		- Defensive Ultimate : Temporarily boosts armor, reduces incoming damage, or provides a powerful damage absorption shield.
		- Support Ultimate : Enhances allies, either boosting their damage, increasing movement speed, or healing the group over time.
	- Cooldown : Once used, the Ultimate Skill has a lengthy cooldown, ranging from 20 to 40 minutes depending on its potency.

	3. Ultimate Skill Enhancement at Level 100 :
	- Additional Ultimate Choice : At level 100, players may choose a second Ultimate Skill (from the remaining two categories), with a 50% chance to 
gain an extra skill slot.
	- Increased Impact : At this level, each Ultimate Skill has additional effects that further amplify its value in PvP and PvE, such as wider AoE 
range, enhanced buffs, or extra healing for Support Ultimates.
   
	4. Integration with Fury Charge System :
	- Continuous Fury Charge Regeneration : Fury regenerates steadily during battles, with some skills allowing players to accelerate Fury gain 
through a temporary boost effect.
	- Fury Item Bonuses : Select items provide a bonus to Fury regeneration, allowing players to reach Ultimate thresholds quicker in high-pressure 
scenarios.
   
	5. Visual and Tactical Effects :
	- Skill Visual Upgrades : Ultimate Skills have unique, dramatic animations that make them easily identifiable in combat, emphasizing the power 
behind each use.
	- Strategic Timing : Due to the long cooldown and powerful effects, players must time the use of their Ultimate Skills carefully, especially in 
PvP and high-difficulty PvE encounters.
