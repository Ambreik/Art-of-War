			The Knights

		Origin and History  
	The "Knights" trace their origin to "King Aric Bolemir", humanity’s first leader who, after drinking from the Waters of Immortality, gained eternal life. King 
Aric’s unyielding leadership and strength became the foundation of the Knights, who now serve as the principal military force in the "Dendera Continent". After 
centuries, King Aric remains alive, seated on his throne in "Dendera Capital City", where he rules with wisdom, guiding the Knights with the same vision that has 
endured for generations.

	The Knights are a disciplined and honorable order, dedicated to the defense of humanity and the upholding of the law. They serve under a strict code of honor, 
believing their duty is to protect the realm from external threats, and they stand as one of the strongest military forces in the World Game.

		Races and Classes of the Knights  
	The Knights are composed of several distinct races and classes. Each race brings its own unique abilities and strengths to the order:

1. "Ninja Race"  
	- Ninja Archer : Masters of ranged combat, skilled with bows and stealth, they strike swiftly and silently.
	- Ninja Assassin : Specialize in close-quarters combat, using agility and poison to take down their enemies before they even know what hit them.

4. "Vampire Race"  
	- Vampires within the Knights are a rare and powerful faction of warriors, who, despite their immortality, still adhere to the Knight’s Code. They do not possess specific classes but instead use their natural abilities to support the group, often specializing in dark magic or enhanced physical strength.

		Territory and Locations  
	The "Knights" are spread across the "Dendera Continent", which is divided into three primary regions:

1. Dendera (Lv. 1 - 20) : The starting region of the Knights. It houses the "Dendera Capital City", where King Aric Bolemir resides. This city serves as the central
hub for the Knights, where new recruits are trained and inducted into the order.

2. Fanthe'kar (Lv. 20 - 40) : A region that serves as the training grounds for intermediate-level Knights. Here, the Knights learn advanced combat tactics and 
participate in numerous trials to prepare for the more dangerous missions in Garland.

3. Garland (Lv. 40 - 60) : The highest level region in Dendera, where elite Knights are forged in the heat of battle. Garland is home to numerous fortresses, 
strategic points, and hidden locations critical for the defense of the continent.

		Structure and Ranks  
	The hierarchy of the Knights is as follows:
- King Aric Bolemir : The eternal ruler and Grandmaster of the Knights, whose decisions guide the entire order.
- High Commander : The second-in-command, responsible for overseeing missions and daily operations.
- Knight-Captains : Leaders of specific knight squads or battalions, responsible for commanding troops in battle.

		Notable Orders

*Lightbright Shields – Knights clad in golden armor, who are the strongest soldiers in the army. They stand as the front line in the most challenging battles and 
embody the pinnacle of knightly strength and endurance.

		The Code of the Knights
		
	The "Radiant Shield Code" is the moral and ethical code that governs all members of the Knights. It includes:
- "Protection of the Innocent" : Knights are sworn to protect the weak and ensure justice for all.
- "Loyalty to the Realm" : Their allegiance is to King Aric and the realm of humanity, placing the interests of the kingdom above personal desires.
- "Honor and Courage" : A knight must act with honor in all circumstances, facing danger without hesitation and without resorting to dishonorable tactics.

		Relationship with Pindars and Outlaws  
- "Pindars" : The Knights view the "Pindars" with cautious respect. While Pindars are mercenaries and often act independently, their skills are valuable to the Knights during times of dire need. However, the Knights distrust the Pindars’ loose morals and transient loyalty.

- "Outlaws" : The Knights hold a deep disdain for the "Outlaws", considering them traitors to humanity. Their betrayal of their factions and their embrace of 
darkness make them enemies of the state. The Knights relentlessly hunt Outlaws, seeking to purge them from the continent for their criminal actions.
