			Gank

	Description : Ganking refers to a tactic where a player or group of players uses overwhelming force to kill an opposing player in Player vs. Player (PvP) combat. 
Typically, a ganker is a higher-level player with superior gear or one who waits for the right opportunity to kill their target, such as when the target is at low 
health or engaged with a mob.

- Ganking in Outland Territories :
  - With the introduction of the "Outland Territories" continent and the "Archaeology" profession, ganking has become a common activity.  
  - High-level players travel across the "Game World" to find archaeological fragments, often overlapping with areas where lower-level players are questing. This 
overlap creates frequent opportunities for gankers to ambush unsuspecting targets, making ganking a widespread activity in these zones.
