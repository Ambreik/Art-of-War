			Line of Sight (LOS)

	Description : Line of Sight (LOS) refers to an unobstructed path from your character to an enemy. Many abilities, spells, and ranged attacks require LOS to 
activate. If there is no clear view, the action will be canceled with a message indicating the obstruction.

- Casting & Movement :
	- Channeled Spells : When casting a channeled spell on an aggroed enemy, any obstruction that blocks LOS during the cast will cancel the spell. For example, if 
you're on the ground casting a spell on a mob that moves behind pillars or obstacles, the cast will be interrupted. However, for spells with a duration, if LOS is 
regained, the spell may continue on the next tick.
  
- Obstructions : 
	- LOS can be obstructed by terrain, walls, structures, and other environmental features, requiring players to reposition to regain LOS.
	- Intentional Obstruction : Players can intentionally break LOS by running behind obstacles, forcing enemies to move into more advantageous positions for the 
player.
  
- LoS Tactics :
	- Pulling Strategy : Players (usually tanks) can use LOS to pull difficult groups of enemies. The tank will attack one mob and quickly hide behind an obstacle, 
breaking the LOS between the mob and their aggro target. This causes the mobs to follow the tank around the corner. It's important that other players do not draw 
aggro while the pull is in effect. Once the mobs are in position, they can be engaged at short range.
	- This strategy is especially useful against ranged enemies or casters, who otherwise maintain distance from the party.

- Important Notes :
	- Environmental Obstructions : Uneven terrain, staircases, walls, and other structures can block LOS, causing ranged actions to fail.
	- Character Size : LOS checks are based on midsection to midsection, meaning shorter characters may experience more frequent "No Line of Sight" messages.
	- Outdoor vs. Indoor LOS : Terrain (dirt and trees) only obstructs LOS indoors. Outdoors, dirt and most trees do not block spells or abilities.
	- Latency and Packet Loss : These can affect LOS. Players may perceive a clear path, but due to lag, the target may be obscured, or the enemy might teleport 
behind an obstruction.
