			PvP or Player vs. Player

	Description : In "World Game," Player vs. Player (PvP) denotes combat between players, contrasting with Player vs. Environment (PvE), where players face 
computer-controlled enemies or elements. PvP includes various combat formats, such as duels, battlegrounds, world PvP, and arena matches.

		Types of PvP :
	"World Game" offers multiple ways for players to engage in PvP, each with unique formats, rewards, and challenges:

- Dueling : A direct 1v1 combat format where players can accept or decline challenges. Duels take place outside human settlements or certain NPC zones with 
"PvP Flag" immunity. There are no rewards aside from the satisfaction of victory.

- Battlegrounds : Large-scale team-based combat, such as capture the flag or resource races. Battlegrounds vary in size, from 10v10 to 40v40, and feature specific 
objectives, maps, and level brackets for fairness.  
	- Rated Battlegrounds : More intense and strategic, using premade teams for increased competition and rewards.  
	- PvP Brawls : Special battlegrounds that introduce unpredictability and evergreen content.

- PvP Zones : Large, non-instanced zones featuring vehicles and destructible buildings. Teams are adjusted to match the number of participants, and victories grant 
access to dailies, rewards, and sometimes raids.

- Arena : Instanced, deathmatch-style PvP between factions. Arena matches focus purely on combat without objectives, offering highly competitive gameplay in 1v1, 
2v2, and 3v3 modes, available from level 70. Pets, certain potions, and food are allowed in arenas.

- Guild Wars : Special combat maps designed for "Orders" or "Clans" to compete against each other. Maps include "Capture the Flag," "Field-Guild War," and
"Arena-Guild War," with winning teams earning "Rank Points" and experience for their guilds. Guild Wars are initiated by "Order Master" or "Clan Master."

- War Games : User-initiated, unrated practice matches in any arena or battleground. These matches do not offer experience, achievements, or win/loss tracking but 
are used for practice, fun, and recruitment. Players can fight with teams of unequal sizes or factions.

- World PvP : Spontaneous and unstructured PvP combat in the open world, where players can engage each other unpredictably. This type of PvP is often unprovoked and
chaotic, especially when players are flagged for PvP. Rewards for world PvP were introduced with the "Battle for Azeroth" update.
