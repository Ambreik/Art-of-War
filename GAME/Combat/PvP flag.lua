			PvP Flag

	The "PvP flag" determines whether a player can engage in or be engaged by PvP combat in "Outdoor" locations. Players can toggle their PvP status through the 
"Game Options" menu, under the "PvP Mode" settings. The available modes are:

- "Peace" : Default mode, where the player's name is displayed in yellow. PvP combat is not enabled unless players are specifically flagged as PvP opponents. Players cannot attack or be attacked by their own faction members.
  
- "Enemy" : Players with this flag are marked in red. This mode is typically used for "PK Players" (Player Killers) or those who are considered traitors within their 
faction. Players can be attacked by members of any faction.

- "Alliance" : In this mode, players cannot attack members of their own "Order" or "Clan" but can engage other players in PvP. Players in this mode are shown in red,
indicating they are flagged for PvP but are restricted from harming their own faction.

- "Free Flag" : Players in this mode have the ability to attack anyone, including members of their "Order" or "Clan". Their name is displayed in purple. This is the 
most aggressive flag, allowing attacks on NPCs, pets, Guardians, and even Barons.

	PvP Flag Rules :

- If a player's PvP flag is enabled, they can be attacked and engaged in combat by players from the opposite faction or within the same faction 
(depending on the mode).
  
- Players in the same faction cannot attack each other if their PvP flag is off. If they are in different PvP modes, they may be able to attack each other based on 
their flag settings. However, players who attack members of the same faction will face consequences:
	- If a player with the "PvP Flag" kills a faction member, the player's name remains unchanged but will lose "Grade" points, which could affect their standing in 
the game. The player will lose fewer points than the actual killer.
  
- Players should be cautious about party members, as attacking faction members with a PvP flag enabled can have penalties, especially in "Outdoor" areas.

- The color of the player's name reflects their PvP flag status:
	- "Yellow" : Default, no PvP engagement.
	- "Red" : Active in "Enemy" mode or flagged as a traitor.
	- "Purple" : "Free Flag" mode, allowing attacks on anyone, including their own faction members.

The PvP flag adds layers of strategy and caution, encouraging players to think carefully about when and how they engage in PvP, especially in shared outdoor areas.
