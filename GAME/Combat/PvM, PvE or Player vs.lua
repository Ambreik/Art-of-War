			PvM, PvE, or Player vs. Environment

	"Player vs. Environment" (PvE), commonly abbreviated as "PvE", refers to the gameplay mode where players face challenges posed by the game world, typically 
controlled by artificial intelligence (AI), instead of engaging in combat with other players. It encompasses various in-game activities where players battle or 
interact with computer-controlled entities such as monsters, NPCs (non-player characters), and environmental hazards.

	PvE can include a broad range of activities such as:

- "Dungeons" : Challenging areas filled with monsters or puzzles, often requiring teams of players to complete.
- "Raids" : Large-scale PvE events typically involving high-level players fighting powerful bosses in group settings.
- "Grinding" : Repeatedly defeating enemies to gather resources, experience points, or loot.
- "Questing" : Completing tasks or objectives set by NPCs to progress the storyline or earn rewards.

	PvE-focused players tend to prioritize developing their characters for these types of challenges rather than engaging in PvP (Player vs. Player) combat. As a 
result, "PvE players" often join "PvE guilds", which specialize in high-end raiding or other environment-based content.

	Since many customizations, such as talents, enchantments, and gear, can be more beneficial for PvE rather than PvP, certain gear and weapons are considered more 
optimal for PvE, often being referred to as "PvE weapons."

	Additional Notes :

- "PvE" is the basic gameplay experience in "World Game", where players interact with the world and its challenges, rather than with other players.
- "PvE" is sometimes colloquially referred to as "Player vs. Everything/Everyone", though "PvM" (Player vs. Monster) is also a term used, especially when referring to
monster-based encounters.
