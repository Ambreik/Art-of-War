			PvP Grade

	General Information : The "PvP Grade" system evaluates a character's reputation, skill, and alignment within PvP environments. It reflects whether a player is 
a respected warrior ("Good/Blue Grade") or an "Outlaw" who has betrayed their faction ("Bad/Red Grade"). The system ties rankings to the number of kills and faction
alignment, enhancing the competitive aspect of PvP.

	Grade Progression and Demotion

- "Good Grades" : Players progress by defeating enemy players in faction-approved PvP activities, gaining "Blue Grade Points" for every kill.  
- "Bad Grades" :  Players accrue "Red Grade Points" for killing faction allies, neutral characters, or NPCs, causing rank degradation.  

- "Demotion System":  If a "Good Grade" player performs dishonorable actions (e.g., ally kills),they lose points and risk being demoted to a "Red Grade". Similarly,
an "Outlaw" can redeem themselves through faction-related quests, reducing their "Red Grade Points".
