			World Bosses

	1. Overview

	Definition : World bosses are high-tier monsters that spawn in open-world areas, designed for multiple players to engage simultaneously. They are not dungeon-
limited and usually serve as a pinnacle challenge for high-level players, requiring coordination, strategy, and often raid-sized groups to defeat.

	Key Characteristics :

* Giant Model : Most world bosses are visually massive, signaling threat and requiring players to adapt positioning.
* Arena Design : Boss spawn locations are carefully crafted arenas to allow strategic positioning and prevent interference from other monsters.
* Combat Characteristics : World bosses are capable of massive AoE damage, crowd control effects, and have mechanics that punish poor positioning or lack of 
coordination.
* Elemental Themes : Many world bosses are tied to the environment or region they spawn in, with fire, ice, shadow, or elemental themes that influence their 
abilities.

	Additional Notes :
* World bosses often introduce special mechanics not found in regular or elite monsters.
* Participation may be limited per player cap to prevent server-wide imbalance.

	2. World Boss Categories

1. Regular World Bosses
	* Location : Typically found in the third region of each continent.
	* Group Size : Can be engaged by up to 12 players.
	* Respawn Rate : Spawns every 4–8 hours.
	* Difficulty : Standard high-level challenge with notable AoE abilities and moderate CC mechanics.

2. Elite World Bosses
	* Location : Spawn in the Outland Territories or specific high-difficulty zones.
	* Difficulty : Higher HP, stronger damage, more complex mechanics than regular world bosses. Often include mini-phases or companion monsters that buff or 
protect the boss.

3. Event World Bosses
	* Spawn Method : Only spawned by admins or during special events.
	* Difficulty : Extremely challenging with unique mechanics, enrage timers, or transformation phases.
	* Participation : Requires large-scale player coordination, often raid-level groups (12+ players).

	3. Common Mechanics

	Health Pools :

* World bosses have massive HP, often with multiple HP bars to visually indicate progression.
* Elite and event world bosses may have regenerating health thresholds or shields that require special mechanics to remove.

* Can apply crowd control effects such as knockbacks, stuns, slows, silences, or DoTs.

	Minions & Support Units :

* Some bosses summon minions for healing, buffing, or additional attacks.
* Minions may need to be killed to effectively damage the boss, adding a layer of strategy.

	Participation Rules :

* Damage and participation may be limited per player; mechanics can prioritize certain roles like tanks or DPS.
* Certain attacks may scale depending on party size or average player level in the encounter.

	Special Behavior :

	4. Combat Phases & Abilities

	Overview : World bosses often have multiple combat phases that trigger based on HP thresholds, time elapsed, or specific mechanics being completed. Each phase 
introduces new abilities, enrage timers, or environmental hazards that require players to adapt their strategy continuously.

---

	Phase Structure

1. Phase 1 – Intro / Initial Engagement
	* The boss uses basic attacks and minor AoE abilities.
	* Minions may be summoned for support or to distract players.
	* Players can study patterns and position themselves effectively.

2. Phase 2 – Mid-Fight Escalation
	* Triggered at around 50%-70% HP.
	* Boss introduces secondary abilities such as area-wide stuns, knockbacks, or elemental attacks.
	* May summon additional minions or create terrain hazards (e.g., fire patches, ice zones).

3. Phase 3 – Enrage / Final Stage
	* Triggered below 25%-30% HP or after a fixed time.
	* Boss enters "Rage Mode" (see Monster.lua core file mechanics). Damage and attack speed increase significantly.
	* Signature abilities and AoEs reach maximum potency.
	* Players must coordinate interrupts, crowd control, or defensive cooldowns to survive.

---

	Abilities & Mechanics

* Signature Abilities : Each boss has 2–4 core skills that define the encounter. Examples include:
	* Ground Slam : Large AoE knockback and damage.
	* Meteor Shower : Targets multiple areas for massive fire/elemental damage.
	* Energy Drain / Vampiric Ability : Reduces player resources while healing the boss.
* Crowd Control Mechanics :
	* Stuns, slows, silences, or displacements to punish clustering or poor positioning.
* Minion Buffs / Debuffs :
	* Some minions buff the boss or debuff players if not eliminated quickly.

---

	Environmental Combat Integration

* Some phases manipulate the environment:
	* Summon walls, lava pools, or traps that affect player movement.
	* Change lighting, visibility, or weather to create disorientation.
* Terrain hazards may persist between phases or escalate with enrage timers.

---

	Tactical Considerations

* Role Importance :
	* Tanks must manage threat and soak AoE.
	* DPS must prioritize high-threat minions or interruptable abilities.
	* Healers must manage raid-wide damage spikes and debuffs.

* Phase Transition Mechanics :
	* Boss may briefly become untargetable during phase transitions or summon barriers.
	* Players may need to trigger mechanics, destroy objects, or defeat adds to progress the fight.
  
---

	5. Environmental Integration

	Overview : World Bosses are not just powerful enemies; their encounters often integrate the surrounding environment to create dynamic and challenging fights. 
Proper environmental integration ensures players must adapt positioning, movement, and tactics beyond just attacking the boss.

---

	Arena Design

* Open Arenas :
	* Large outdoor zones allow for ranged and melee engagement.
	* Provide natural hazards such as cliffs, rivers, or lava pools.

* Closed Arenas :
	* Indoor or dungeon arenas restrict movement, forcing players to prioritize AoE awareness and positioning.
	* Can contain environmental mechanics like collapsing floors, traps, or barriers.

---

	Terrain Hazards

* Static Hazards :
	* Pre-existing environmental features like spikes, lava pools, or poisonous swamps.
	* Players must avoid or mitigate these while fighting the boss.

* Dynamic Hazards :
	* Triggered by boss abilities, such as falling rocks, fire waves, or electrified zones.
	* Often linked to combat phases or Rage Mode, requiring players to constantly reposition.

---

	Day/Night & Weather Effects

* Certain bosses are influenced by time-of-day mechanics or weather:
	* Nighttime bosses may gain invisibility, increased stealth, or movement speed.
	* Storms, fog, or rain can obscure vision, reduce movement, or enhance specific abilities.
* Environmental modifiers can scale damage, debuffs, or summon additional minions.

---

	Interactive Terrain Mechanics

* Destructible Terrain :
	* Certain structures can be destroyed by the boss or players to affect combat.
	* Examples: walls that block AoE, statues that reduce boss power when destroyed.

* Buff Zones :
	* Some arenas contain areas that grant temporary buffs or debuffs to the boss or players.

* Environmental Triggers :
	* Stepping into specific zones may trigger traps, summon adds, or alter boss behavior.

---

	Tactical Considerations

* Players must constantly adapt to the environment while maintaining DPS and healing rotations.
* Knowledge of arena layout is crucial to survive "Rage Mode", phase transitions, and AoE attacks.
* Bosses may manipulate terrain to divide or isolate players, rewarding coordinated group strategy.

	6. Spawn & Encounter Rules

	Overview : World Bosses are unique events in the game world. Their spawn rules, encounter conditions, and triggers must create anticipation, strategy, and 
challenge for players.

---

	Spawn Points

* Fixed Locations :
	* Specific open-world locations (e.g., valleys, volcanoes, ancient ruins).
	* Often marked on the map or revealed through quests or world events.

* Dynamic/Hidden Locations :
	* Certain World Bosses may spawn randomly or in secret zones.
	* Clues or in-game events (quests, faction control, rare items) can reveal spawn points.

---

	Spawn Timing

* Scheduled Respawns :
	* Bosses may respawn at fixed intervals (e.g., every 24 hours).
	* Servers may announce spawn timers to encourage participation.

* Conditional Spawns :
	* Triggered by player actions, such as completing a dungeon, defeating elite monsters, or faction achievements.

---

	Pre-Fight Conditions

* Minimum Player Requirements :
	* Some bosses require a full party or raid to engage.
	* Solo or small groups attempting the fight may trigger an automatic Rage Mode or cannot deal damage.

* Event-Linked Conditions :
	* Environmental events or world progress (like unlocking a dungeon or territory) can gate the encounter.

---

	Engagement Mechanics

* Aggro Initiation :
	* Boss becomes active when players enter the arena or trigger a specific zone.
* Leash Mechanics :
	* Boss cannot be kited too far from the spawn location.
	* Grace radius allows minor player retreat without resetting the encounter.

* Phase Triggers :
	* Health thresholds, timed enrage, or specific player actions trigger new combat phases.
