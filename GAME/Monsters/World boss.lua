			World Boss

		World Boss Overview
	Definition : World bosses are raid boss-level monsters that appear in the "main, shared game world" (outdoors) rather than being confined to dungeons or instances. They are designed to be fought by "one or more raid-sized groups" of max-level characters, though lower-level characters can also participate.

- Key Features :
  - "Giant Model" : World bosses are typically large, imposing creatures with complex mechanics.
  - "Arenas" : When a world boss spawns, their location is specifically designed for the encounter, and no other monsters or NPCs are found in the area.
  - "Combat Characteristics" : World bosses are capable of using large "AoE (Area of Effect) skills", "crowd control (CC) abilities", and can deal significant magic
 or physical damage. They may also have companions that "heal, buff", or "protect" the boss during combat.
  - "Element" : The element of the boss usually relates to the region in which they are located, adding thematic relevance.
