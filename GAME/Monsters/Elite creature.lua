			Elite Creature

	1. Introduction

	Elite Creatures represent a step above regular monsters in terms of challenge, durability, and impact within the game world. They are designed to push players 
beyond the routine of farming basic mobs by requiring more strategy, preparation, and sometimes cooperation.

	Unlike "Normal Monsters", which serve as the backbone of the ecosystem, or "Rare Monsters", which offer unique rewards but are generally soloable, 
"Elite Creatures" pose a semi-boss challenge in both open-world and instanced encounters. They are distinguished not only by their enhanced stats but also by their 
special mechanics, abilities, and higher rewards.

	Elite Creatures are often tied to world-building and narrative immersion:

* They may guard special locations (ancient ruins, cursed groves, dungeons).
* They frequently serve as mini-objectives for quests or faction progression.
* They act as milestones for measuring player progression across zones and regions.

	In visual terms, Elites are easily identifiable with larger models, aura effects, or icon markers above their heads, ensuring players recognize them instantly 
as a threat beyond ordinary foes.

	2. Categories & Types

	Elite Creatures come in several distinct categories, each with their own role in the ecosystem and difficulty level:

1. Normal Elite
	* Stronger than regular mobs, with significantly higher health and damage output.
	* Often roam in patrols or guard key areas.
	* Designed to be a small-group challenge but may be soloable by well-prepared or high-level players.

2. Rare Elite (Silver Elite)
	* A hybrid between Rare Monsters and Elite status.
	* Spawn less frequently, with unique patrol routes or guarded spawn points.
	* Drop rare loot, crafting reagents, or cosmetic items.
	* Identified by a silver dragon or aura effect around their portrait/nameplate.

3. Elite Bosses
	* Mini-boss tier enemies that often appear at the end of dungeons, elite dens, or as zone-wide threats.
	* Feature multiple phases, scripted mechanics, and possible Rage Mode integration.
	* Require teamwork or exceptional solo skill to defeat.
	* May serve as gatekeepers for quests, dungeon progression, or special loot.

4. Special Subtypes (Optional / Conditional)
	* Tamed Elite : Certain elite creatures can be subdued, losing their elite status and becoming companions, mounts, or summoned allies.
	* Dungeon Elites : Elites specifically designed for dungeon encounters, often tuned for small groups and carrying dungeon-specific mechanics 
	(e.g., synergy with traps, ambushes, or environmental hazards).

	This tiered approach allows the Elite Creature system to scale with the player’s journey: from their first encounter with a daunting patrolling elite in early 
zones, to facing Elite Bosses deep within dangerous dungeons or contested world zones.

	3. Attributes & Scaling

	Elite Creatures are defined by enhanced core stats and scaling values that make them more dangerous than regular mobs:

* Health & Damage Multipliers :
	* Elites have between 3x – 10x health of a standard monster of the same level.
	* Damage output is increased by 2x – 5x, depending on the category (Normal Elite vs Elite Boss).

* Armor & Resistances :
	* Higher physical armor and elemental resistances.
	* Often tied to the creature’s biome (e.g., fire elites resist fire, swamp elites resist poison).

* Scaling Rules :
	* Elite stats scale with zone tier, player progression, and group size (outdoor elites slightly adapt to the number of nearby players).
	* Dungeon Elites are tuned for group content and do not dynamically scale, keeping their difficulty consistent.

* Unique Modifiers :
	* Some Elites gain rage thresholds (damage increases when low HP).
	* Others have environmental buffs (forest elites stronger at night, swamp elites heal in water).

	This ensures that Elites feel more like designed encounters rather than simple stat-bloated mobs.

	4. Behavior Mechanics

	Elite Creatures differ from normal monsters in how they act and engage with players:

* Aggro Range :
	* Elites have wider detection ranges (20–40% larger than regular monsters).
	* Some use scripted ambushes or patrol routes to surprise players.

* Group Dynamics :
	* Many Elites are accompanied by minions or weaker mobs, forcing players to deal with adds before focusing on the Elite itself.
	* Elite Leaders may buff nearby mobs, making them more dangerous when not isolated.

* Retreat & Reset :
	* Unlike standard mobs, most Elites do not retreat when low on HP.
	* Certain Elite Bosses may enter new combat phases instead of fleeing.

* Dormancy / Guard Mode :
	* Some Elites stand guard at critical points (e.g., dungeon entrances, treasure areas).
	* Others may be territorial roamers, attacking anything that enters their domain.

* Unique States :
	* A few Elites feature Night/Day behavior changes (similar to Night Monsters).
	* Example: A swamp Elite that is sluggish by day but frenzied at night.

	5. Combat Mechanics & Abilities

	Elite combat is designed to demand more than simple DPS. These monsters employ mechanics and abilities that punish careless play:

* Special Attacks :
	* Wide-area cleaves, cone attacks, or shockwaves that require positioning.
	* Debuff-inflicting strikes (bleed, poison, burn, slow).

* Crowd Control (CC) :
	* Stuns, fears, silences, or roots that can disable players briefly.
	* Some Elites chain CCs with their minions for tactical difficulty.

* Elite Boss Phases :
	* At HP thresholds (e.g., 70% / 40% / 10%), new mechanics trigger.
	* Examples: Summoning reinforcements, activating Rage Mode, or creating environmental hazards.

* Environmental Interactions :
	* Some Elites may use the terrain — collapsing rocks, igniting flammable patches, or pushing players into hazards.

* Signature Abilities (examples):
	* Howl of Terror – AoE fear against players.
	* Savage Leap – Gap-closer with stun impact.
	* Thorn Armor – Reflects a percentage of melee damage back.
	* Frenzy (Rage Mode tie-in) – Attack speed and damage increase when below 25% HP.

	This section makes Elites recognizable as mini-boss fights — encounters where player awareness, resource management, and teamwork are tested.

	6. Environmental Integration

	Elite Creatures are often tightly bound to their environment, reinforcing the idea that they are guardians of specific places rather than random spawns:

* Biome Affinity :
	* Fire Elites thrive in volcanic or desert zones, gaining partial fire immunity.
	* Swamp Elites regenerate HP when standing in water.
	* Forest Elites camouflage among trees and are harder to detect.

* Territorial Control :
	* Elites may claim zones—until they are killed, weaker mobs may spawn less frequently in the area.
	* Some Elites buff nearby wildlife, turning normal mobs more aggressive or durable.

* Day/Night Cycles :
	* Certain Elites change strength or mechanics based on time of day.
	* Example: A spectral Elite is intangible by day but fully materializes at night.

* Environmental Hazards :
	* Some Elites alter the environment during combat—spreading fire, corrupting ground, freezing terrain, or summoning fog.
	* Hazards persist temporarily after combat, making the area riskier for other players.

	7. Spawn & Encounter Mechanics

	Elite encounters are designed to feel rare, memorable, and challenging :

* Spawn Points :
	* Elites spawn at fixed locations tied to lore, dungeons, or resource hotspots.
	* Some Elites are roaming encounters, patrolling large zones.

* Respawn Timers :
	* Longer than regular monsters, often 30–120 minutes depending on category.
	* Dungeon Elites respawn only after a full reset or scripted event.

* Encounter Design :
	* Outdoor Elites may spawn with supporting minions or in packs.
	* Dungeon Elites can be scripted into waves, traps, or puzzle mechanics that trigger combat.

* Dynamic Events :
	* Some Elites only appear during world events, weather conditions, or faction control phases.
	* Example: A storm elemental Elite that only spawns during thunderstorms.

* Scaling Encounters :
	* Elite difficulty can adjust slightly based on party size (extra minions, higher HP), but core abilities remain fixed to preserve encounter design.

	8. Loot & Rewards

	Elites reward players with higher quality loot compared to standard monsters, designed to justify the risk and time investment:

* Loot Table Hierarchy :
	* Each Elite has an individual loot table (weapons, armor, crafting mats).
	* Drop rates are higher for rare and uncommon items than standard mobs.

* Unique Drops :
	* Elites may drop exclusive gear skins, cosmetics, or rare crafting materials.
	* Some are tied to profession quests (e.g., Elite Miner dropping a rare ore only usable in advanced recipes).

* Currency Rewards :
	* Small chance of dropping faction tokens, reputation items, or currency bundles.
	* Dungeon Elites often guarantee event tokens or progression keys.

* Pity Mechanics :
	* Clearing all Elites in a dungeon guarantees at least one rare-quality item.
	* Outdoor Elites may grant bonus XP or reputation upon first kill each day.

* Minion vs Elite Loot :
	* Minions drop low-tier loot (crafting mats, consumables).
	* Elite Bosses drop the primary rewards, often with loot scaling depending on group participation.

	9. Integration with World Systems

	Elite Creatures are not isolated challenges—they tie directly into the wider progression, economy, and exploration systems of the game:

* Level Progression :
	* Elites act as milestones in leveling zones, introducing harder mechanics early to train players for dungeon/raid combat.
	* Some Elites gate progression quests (defeating one might be required to unlock a new region).

* Faction & Reputation :
	* Certain Elites are tied to faction conflicts—killing them grants reputation points or weakens opposing factions in contested areas.
	* Elite “champions” of a faction may appear during territory wars.

* Economy & Professions :
	* Drops like rare hides, ores, essences are exclusive to Elites and required for high-tier crafting.
	* Some Elites drop profession recipes or unlock blueprints for crafting stations.

* Dungeon & Raid Systems :
	* Elites often act as mini-bosses in dungeons, breaking monotony between trash packs and bosses.
	* Raid Elites may serve as optional encounters that provide shortcuts, buffs, or lore rewards.

* Dynamic World Events :
	* World bosses may spawn Elite “scouts” or “lieutenants” before appearing themselves.
	* Killing certain Elites can trigger world changes, such as lifting a local debuff zone or unlocking new NPC vendors.

	10. Other Mechanics (Optional)

	To add long-term variety, optional mechanics can make Elite encounters feel fresh and unpredictable:

* Seasonal Variants :
	* Elites may gain unique abilities or appearances during events (e.g., a "Winter Frost Beast" with snowstorm mechanics).

* Roaming Warbands :
	* Instead of static spawns, some Elites travel the map with small armies of followers, forcing players to hunt them down.

* Cross-Faction Elites :
	* Some Elites fight each other (orc vs elf champions) and players can intervene, rewarding the side they helped.

* Evolving Threats :
	* Elites that grow stronger if ignored—left alive too long, they start attacking villages, taking territory, or spreading corruption.

* Pet/Mount Taming :
	* Rare cases where Elite Beasts can be captured as mounts or pets, requiring specific skills or items.

* Legendary Quests :
	* A select few Elites are tied to epic quest chains, dropping unique keys or quest-only loot.
