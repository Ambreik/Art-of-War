			Elite Creature

		Elite Creature Overview
	Definition : Elite creatures are stronger, tougher mobs or NPCs that require higher-level players or groups to defeat. They often possess additional buffs,
abilities, and unique traits compared to standard creatures.
- Usage : Elite creatures are commonly found in questing areas, dungeons, and raids. They are often a central part of group quests, typically serving as significant challenges or culminating encounters in a storyline.

	Types of Elite Creatures
1. "Normal Elite" : These creatures have superior strength, health, and abilities than regular mobs of the same level. They often require a group to defeat and are generally rare in outdoor areas.
2. "Rare Elite" : Also known as silver elites, these creatures are rarer than standard elite creatures. They are often located in outdoor zones and can be difficult to find and defeat.
3. "Elite Bosses" : These are bosses that are even tougher than regular bosses, with significantly more health, damage, and special abilities. They are larger than normal bosses and typically appear with an additional visual effect (such as a fire effect around their legs).

	Characteristics of Elite Creatures
- "Health and Damage" : Elite creatures generally have increased health and damage compared to regular creatures of the same level, with some even possessing special abilities or spells.
- "Loot and Experience" : Elite creatures reward players with better loot and more experience than standard mobs. The difficulty and effort required to defeat them are reflected in the rewards.
- "Group Requirements" : Most elite creatures, especially in dungeons and raids, require multiple players to defeat due to their higher power and difficulty.

	Other Important Notes
- "Appearance" :  Elite creatures are often visually distinct, typically being larger than normal monsters and marked with the word "Elite" in their name. They also tend to have an orange target effect, and elite bosses may have a combination of red and orange effects, with additional visual effects like fire around their legs.
- "Elite Mobs in Instances" :  Elite mobs in dungeons and raids enforce the group dynamic required for these areas. These mobs are often much stronger than normal creatures, making solo attempts extremely difficult.
- "Taming" :  Elite creatures tamed by hunters lose their elite status and associated unique abilities.
- "Difficulty Scaling" :  While there is no fixed formula for the strength difference between an elite creature and a regular mob, it is generally expected that elite mobs will be significantly harder to defeat and may require specialized tactics.
