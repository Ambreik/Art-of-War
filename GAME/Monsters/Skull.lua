	Skull Mobs Overview
- "Skull Icon" : When a mob is considered a Skull Mob, it displays a small skull icon above its head. This icon indicates that the mob is hostile towards the player and is significantly higher in level than the player, typically 10 or more levels above.
  
- "Level Display" : When a player hovers over the Skull Mob, its level appears as "??", signaling that its level is unknown or dynamic. This signifies that the mob is much higher level than the player, making it a formidable opponent.

	Skull Type Bosses
- "Dynamic Leveling" : Skull Type Bosses have a unique "dynamic" level. This means that while their level is not explicitly displayed, it is treated as being 3 levels
higher than the player's character level for all combat-related calculations. 
	- For example, if a "level 60 warrior" and a "level 65 healer" face the same Skull Type Boss:
		- The "warrior" would be treated as if facing a level "63 boss" for calculating hit chances, resistances, and other combat mechanics.
		- The "healer" would be treated as if facing a level "68 boss".
	- This dynamic level adjustment makes Skull Type Bosses more challenging, as their attack damage and resistance stats are calculated as though they are several 
levels above the player.

	Toughness and Difficulty
- "Elite Boss Status" : Skull Mobs are often referred to as "Elite Bosses" due to their extreme difficulty. They are considered some of the toughest mobs in the World Game and are typically found in dungeons or run instances.
- "Pre-Boss Encounter" : In most cases, Skull Type Bosses serve as a "pre-boss" in dungeons and raids, meaning they are a key challenge players must overcome before facing the main boss of that area or dungeon.

	General Mechanics
- "Combat" : Because of their dynamic level, Skull Mobs are much harder to hit, and they will deal more damage to players. Additionally, playersâ€™ abilities are less effective against them, as their resistances are adjusted based on the dynamic level.
- "Strategic Encounter" : These bosses require careful preparation, team coordination, and tactical play, as their power surpasses that of normal bosses. They serve as a significant challenge, especially in group content like dungeons and raids.
