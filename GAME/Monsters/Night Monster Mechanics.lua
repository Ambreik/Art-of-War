			Night Monster Mechanics

	Night Monster Mechanics in Forests
- "Sleeping Monsters" : 
  - "Behavior" : In forests at night, some monsters are in a dormant state and lie on the ground, indicated by the "Zzz" effect above them.
  - "Aggression Trigger" : If these monsters are disturbed, either by players or other in-game events, they wake up and become aggressive.
  - "Stats Increase" : Once disturbed or awakened, these monsters gain a 2-10% increase in their stats, making them more challenging to defeat.
  - "Aggro Chain" : Awakened monsters can aggro nearby monsters, triggering additional attacks on the character. This creates a potential chain reaction, leading to multiple enemies attacking the player at once.

	Key Points
- "Environmental Interaction" : The mechanic emphasizes how the time of day (night) and the environment (forest) affect the behavior of certain monsters.
- "Stat Boost" : The stat increase upon waking up makes these encounters more dangerous and adds an additional layer of challenge for players.
- "Aggro Spread" : The ability for monsters to aggro other nearby monsters creates dynamic, potentially overwhelming combat situations, especially when players disturb multiple sleeping creatures at once.
