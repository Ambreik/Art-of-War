			Notorious Monster (NM)

	1. Introduction to Notorious Monsters
- Definition :  
	Notorious Monsters (NMs) are unique, highly challenging bosses that feature complex combat mechanics and require advanced strategies to defeat. 
These creatures are often located in key areas of the game world, such as special zones, dungeons, or instances. NMs typically act as end-game 
encounters or final bosses, with each one being tailored with unique abilities, stages, and combat tactics that change as the battle progresses.
  
- General Characteristics :  
	NMs stand out for their multi-phase encounters, where they have multiple HP Bars, each corresponding to a distinct phase with altered behavior or 
mechanics. The difficulty of these encounters scales with the number of HP Bars, and each new phase presents new challenges for the players involved.

	2. HP Bar System
- Multiple HP Bars :  
	Unlike regular bosses, which typically have a single HP Bar, NMs have multiple HP Bars. Each HP Bar represents a different phase of the encounter,
and when one bar is depleted, the NM transitions to the next phase, often changing its combat mechanics or behavior.  
	- Example: A NM might start with 1 HP Bar (e.g. 1,000,000 HP), but once it's depleted, the next HP Bar appears, which also has 1,000,000 HP. This 
can continue for 2, 3, or more HP Bars, depending on the specific NM.

- Progressive Mechanics :  
	As each new HP Bar is reached, the NM adapts to the ongoing battle and introduces new tactics. This progression forces players to continuously 
adapt their strategies, making each phase feel fresh and more difficult than the last. 

- HP Bar Transitions :  
	Transitioning between HP Bars often introduces new mechanics, such as:  
	- Summoning minions or companions  
	- Changing elemental affinities or gaining buffs  
	- Becoming more aggressive or gaining new, deadly abilities

	3. Combat Mechanics
- Elemental Affinity :  
	NMs are often associated with a particular elemental theme that influences their abilities and attacks. For example, a fire-based NM might 
periodically cast AoE fire attacks or summon fire-based minions. These elemental aspects require players to equip themselves accordingly with 
defensive items or abilities tailored to the NM's specific weaknesses.

- Targeted Attacks :  
	Many NMs have the ability to target specific players based on their role, positioning, or vulnerability. For instance, certain NMs may prioritize 
classes with buffing abilities (like Shamans), or ranged classes like Ninjas. This encourages team coordination and strategic positioning during the 
fight.

- Phase-based Behavior Change :  
	Each phase (HP Bar) of the NM encounter features unique behavior changes, making the fight dynamic:
	- Berserker Mode : When the NM is near a phase transition, it might enter a berserker mode, significantly increasing its damage output for a short
period.
	- Summoning Minions : Some NMs summon additional monsters to assist them as their HP decreases, forcing players to split focus between the NM and 
the new threats.
	- Skill Charging : Some NMs have abilities that require charging, during which time they will gather energy for a devastating attack. Players must
interrupt or avoid these attacks through coordinated group effort.

- Unique Skills :  
	Each NM is designed with a custom set of skills and mechanics, ensuring that no two NMs are alike. Some may have healing capabilities, others may 
inflict debuffs or reduce players' damage output, and some may even become immortal for short durations until a specific condition is met.

	4. Strategic Importance
- Advanced Equipment Requirements :  
	Due to their immense difficulty, NMs typically require players to have highly advanced equipment. This includes high-tier weapons, armor, and 
accessories that offer protection against the NM’s elemental attacks or enhance specific attributes (such as healing, damage reduction, or resistance to debuffs).

- Team Coordination and Roles :  
	Given their complexity, NMs demand strong coordination among raid or party members. Specific roles, such as tanking, healing, and dealing high 
burst damage, are critical. Players must communicate effectively to avoid deadly AoE abilities, manage minions, and adjust to the evolving fight 
phases.

- Adaptation and Progression :  
	As players progress through each HP Bar phase, they must continuously adapt to new tactics, manage resources, and mitigate incoming damage. The 
strategic approach changes each time the NM transitions to the next HP Bar, meaning players must rethink their combat approach with each phase.

	5. Loot and Rewards
- Loot Drops :  
	Defeating an NM yields powerful loot, typically with rare and unique items. These can include:  
	- High-tier armor and weapons  
	- Rare crafting materials  
	- Special items that offer bonuses against specific elements or NMs  

- Loot Distribution :  
	The loot distribution from NMs is usually randomized among participants, ensuring that multiple players are rewarded for their efforts. Rare items
from these encounters might be bind on pickup (BoP) or bind on equip (BoE), with the latter enabling players to trade or sell high-value items.

- Unique Rewards :  
	Many NMs drop unique rewards that may not be available from regular monsters, including rare crafting components, special mounts, or titles. These
items may be linked to the NM's specific mechanics or theme.

	6. Example of Ultimate Notorious Monster: "Tower of Light"
- Location :  
	The Tower of Light is home to one of the most powerful NMs in the game. As the final boss of this area, it presents the ultimate challenge for 
players, requiring them to conquer the toughest obstacles the game has to offer.

- HP Bars :  
	This NM is particularly notorious due to its seven distinct HP Bars, each with a unique set of mechanics and combat strategies. As players 
progress through the phases, the NM’s abilities become increasingly difficult to manage, pushing players to their limits.

- Elemental Theme :  
	The NM in the Tower of Light is associated with the Light Element, which influences its attacks, buffs, and overall strategy. Players must equip 
items that provide Light Element protection or damage mitigation to survive.

- Final Encounter :  
	This NM is often seen as the final test of a player’s skill and teamwork. Only those with the highest level of preparation and strategy will be 
able to defeat it. The reward for defeating such a powerful creature is often reserved for the most accomplished players and provides exclusive items 
and prestige.

	7. Conclusion
- Role in Gameplay :  
	Notorious Monsters serve as the pinnacle of PvE content in the game, offering the most challenging encounters and best rewards. They encourage 
teamwork, strategy, and preparation, making them essential for end-game progression and an integral part of the game’s challenge.
