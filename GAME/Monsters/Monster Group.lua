			Monster Group


	1. Monster Group Overview

	In "World Game", monsters can form groups to provide challenging and strategic encounters. These groups are structured to leverage distinct roles,
elemental affinities, and attack types based on their region, zone, or dungeon. The diversity in group composition and mechanics ensures dynamic 
encounters for players at all levels.

	2. Monster Group Characteristics

- Group Composition :  
	- Groups are found in sizes of 3, 5, or 7 monsters, depending on the zone’s difficulty level.  
	- Groups consist of:  
		- Leader : A tanky monster, often with high HP or enhanced defensive stats (e.g., Armor Class).  
		- Damage Dealers : Melee monsters specializing in high physical or elemental burst damage.  
		- Ranged Creatures : Archers or casters that apply crowd control (CC) or elemental damage.  
		- Assist Monsters : Weaker creatures that serve as distractions or provide indirect support.  

- Regional Damage Types :  
	- Each region introduces unique elemental attack types and status effects, adding complexity to encounters:  
		- Outland Territory : Monsters use elemental damage matching their environment:  
			- Fire Damage : Applies "Burning" over time.  
			- Ice Damage : Applies "Slowdown" to movement and attack speed.  
			- Wind Damage: Applies "Knockback" or "Displacement", pushing players slightly away from their current position and disrupting their 
		positioning.
			- Nature Damage : Applies "Poison" or "Rooting" effects, immobilizing players.  
		- Underworld : Monsters deal "Shadow Damage", often causing "Fear", "Blindness", or "Weakened States".  
		- Legrand : High-level elemental diversity, with monsters using combinations of "Arcane", "Lightning", or "Earth Damage", creating unpredictable challenges.  

- Retaliation Mechanics :  
	- Attacking one member of a group alerts the entire group to retaliate.  
	- Leaders in high-level regions also use skills or regional damage effects to escalate the encounter.

	3. Group Sizes and Placement

- Small Groups (3 monsters) :  
	- Found in starting zones or easy exploration areas, introducing players to group dynamics.  
	- Example:  
		- Leader : Basic melee monster with high HP and a simple defensive effect.  
		- Damage Dealer : Melee monster focusing on physical attacks.  
		- Ranged Creature : Archer applying CC like "Pushback".  

- Medium Groups (5 monsters) :  
	- Common in mid-level zones or areas requiring team play.  
	- Example:  
		- Leader : A tanky creature with defensive abilities or basic skills.  
		- 2 Damage Dealers : Physical melee attackers with moderate health pools.  
		- Ranged Creature : Archer applying "Slowdown" or magical CC like "Root".  
		- Assist Monster : A weaker creature providing buffs or distractions.  

- Large Groups (7 monsters) :  
	- Found in dungeons, advanced exploration zones, and major territories.  
	- Example:  
		- Leader : A tanky monster with regional skills and AoE mechanics.  
		- 2 Damage Dealers : Strong melee monsters specializing in high burst damage.  
		- 2 Ranged Creatures :  
			- 1 Archer applying "Pushback".  
			- 1 Caster dealing elemental damage (Fire, Ice, or Shadow).  
		- Support Monster : A healer or buffer enhancing group performance.  
		- Assist Monster : A trash-tier creature offering minimal threat but serving as a distraction.

	6. Encounter Mechanics

- Strategic Monster Behavior :  
	- Leaders actively use their skills to create synergy within the group.  
	- Ranged and caster creatures focus on disrupting support roles (healers or ranged DPS).  

- Wave Mechanics in Instances :  
	- Large groups often summon reinforcements when a leader reaches a specific HP threshold or is defeated.  
	- Some groups guard "Mystic Stones", which summon additional waves of monsters when attacked.  

- Coordination and Retaliation :  
	- Players attacking from range may trigger countermeasures like "Leap" or "Pull".  
	- Group synergy ensures that CC effects are layered, forcing players to adapt dynamically.
