			Monsters in World Game

		Introduction
	A "mob" (short for monster) is any non-player entity whose primary purpose is to be killed for experience, quest objectives, or loot. Mobs are distinct from 
NPCs in that they do not have unique names, are non-interactive, and exist primarily for combat. Mobs are a core aspect of Player vs. Environment (PvE) content and 
can be found throughout the game world. end 

	Key Differences :
- "Mobs vs. NPCs" : Mobs are typically hostile and non-interactive. NPCs are non-hostile characters that may offer quests or services.
- "Mobs vs. Critters" : Critters are ambient creatures, often providing no loot or experience. They are easy to kill and cannot be targeted using the tab key, unlike mobs.

		Other mechanics :

	1. "Monster Behavior and AI"

	"Aggro Mechanisms"
   - "Proximity Aggro" : Most monsters will engage when a player comes within a certain proximity. The closer a player is to a monster, the more likely the monster 
is to target them. This distance can vary based on the monster's rank and AI behavior. For instance, lower-ranked monsters (Rank I or Rank II) might have a small 
aggro radius, while higher-ranked ones (Rank III and above) have a larger aggro radius and can sense players from further away.
   - "Damage-Triggered Aggro" : If a monster is attacked or damaged by a player, it will immediately target that player. The damage threshold can vary, with 
stronger monsters (Rank IV, V) aggroing even if the damage is minimal, while weaker ones might ignore smaller attacks. 
   - "Healing Aggro" : Some monsters may be aggroed when a player heals themselves or another player. This introduces the concept of "healing aggro," often seen in 
raid situations where healers must be mindful of their positioning.

	"Patrolling Patterns"
   - "Fixed Paths" : Some monsters follow a set route, patrolling a specific area. For example, a "Patrol" monster might patrol a dungeon corridor or the perimeter 
of a settlement. If a player crosses its path, it will aggressively engage. These patrols could be used for challenging players to strategize around their movement 
and avoid detection.
   - "Randomized Movement" : Other monsters may move randomly within a specific area. These types of monsters add an element of unpredictability, requiring players 
to be cautious as they explore.

	"Group Dynamics"
   - "Reinforcements" : High-ranking monsters like Rank III and above might have the ability to summon additional monsters (either from a nearby spawn or as part of
their AI). For example, "Invoker" monsters can create additional mobs once they reach a certain threshold of health.
   - "Coordinated Attacks" : Some monsters might coordinate their attacks, especially in groups. "Berserk" monsters might trigger others to become more aggressive 
when one is injured, creating a cascading effect that makes the battle harder.

	"Retreat Mechanisms"
   - "Desperation Phase" : Some monsters may have a "desperation phase" once their health drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 25% health). In this phase, they 
may move faster, use more powerful abilities, or even attempt to flee. This could create opportunities for players to use certain abilities (e.g., "Hard CC") to 
prevent the escape or retreat.
   - "Escape Mechanisms" : Certain monsters, especially "Coward" or "Ranger" types, might flee when their health is low. This could trigger the player to chase them
or set traps to prevent their escape.

	2. "Monster Special Abilities"

	"Unique Abilities/Skill Sets"
   - "Tanky Monsters" : Tank monsters (Rank III and above) have abilities designed to absorb or mitigate damage. They might use defensive buffs or have self-heals 
like "Regeneration", making them harder to take down in battle.
   - "Berserk Abilities" : Monsters with the "Berserk" trait could gain a significant damage boost once their HP falls below a certain threshold. For example, 
"Berserk" monsters might double their damage when they are below 50% health, requiring players to balance offense and defense carefully.
   - "Vampiric Abilities" : Vampiric monsters drain life force from players, restoring a portion of their own health with every attack or ability used. Some 
"Vampiric" monsters might heal for a percentage of the damage dealt, making them particularly challenging.

	"Environmental Interactions"
   - "Fire Elementals" : Fire-based monsters can interact with their environment by setting it on fire. For example, a "Fire Elemental" might ignite the ground, 
causing "Damage Over Time" (DoTs) to players who stand on fire-affected areas.
   - "Water Elementals" : Water creatures could manipulate water sources within their environment, summoning waves or creating puddles that slow players down or 
create new attack opportunities. For instance, an "Ice Monster" in a water-based environment might cause "Freeze" effects, reducing movement speed.
   - "Earth Elementals" : Earth-based monsters might summon rocks or cause the ground to shake, affecting player movement or blocking paths temporarily.

	3. "Monster Drops and Loot Table"

	"Loot Categories" :
1. "Common Loot" : 
   - Items that are frequently dropped by lower-ranked monsters, such as herbs, ores, and basic consumables.
   - "Examples" : Healing potions, low-level crafting materials (e.g., copper ore), and basic gear (e.g., cloth armor).
   
2. "Uncommon Loot" : 
   - Items that have a moderate drop rate from medium-ranked monsters (Rank II or Rank III). These items are slightly more valuable or higher in quality compared t
common loot.
   - "Examples" : Lesser enchantment stones, rare crafting components (e.g., refined gems), and mid-tier weapons or armor pieces.

3. "Rare Loot" :
   - Drops from higher-ranked monsters (Rank III or IV). These items are special and less frequently dropped, offering unique enhancements or upgrades for players.
   - "Examples" : Rare crafting materials, high-quality weapons, advanced consumables (e.g., Elixirs of Power), or rare cosmetic items.
   
4. "Epic Loot" :
   - High-ranking monsters (Rank V and "World Bosses") drop epic loot. This includes top-tier gear, powerful consumables, and legendary crafting components.
   - "Examples" : Legendary weapons, high-grade armor sets, "Emberstones", or "Runes of Power".

5. "Legendary Loot" :
   - "Legendary Monsters", "World Bosses", and other significant high-tier monsters are capable of dropping the most exclusive loot. These items are highly sought 
after and could provide substantial advantages in combat, crafting, or exploration.
   - "Examples" : Mythical weapons (e.g., "Blades of the Fallen"), god-tier armor, or unique crafting blueprints (e.g., "Forge of the Immortal").

6. "Faction Loot" :
   - Monsters tied to specific factions (such as the "Outlaws", "Guild Factions", or "Divine Orders") drop loot specific to that faction’s lore and crafting needs. 
These items could be special relics, insignia, or faction-based crafting components.
   - "Examples" : "Outlaw Tokens", "Faction Medals", and "Guild Enchanted Artifacts".

7. "Quest-related Loot" :
   - Some monsters drop specific quest-related items that are necessary to progress through the story or faction quests.
   - "Examples" : "Ancient Rune Fragments", "Quest Medals", "Sacred Scrolls", and other mission-based items.

	"Loot Distribution" :
   - For multiplayer or raid situations, loot can be distributed based on "player performance" or "role". For example, tanks may receive defensive items, while 
damage dealers could get offensive gear. Support classes might receive items that enhance healing or utility abilities.
