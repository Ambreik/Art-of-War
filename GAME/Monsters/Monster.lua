			Monsters in World Game

	Introduction : Monsters are the backbone of the world’s ecology and gameplay loop. They provide combat challenges, resources, and dynamic interactions for 
players at all levels. Beyond being simple targets, monsters serve as living extensions of the world’s lore — tied to continents, regions, dungeons, and factions.

	Every monster is designed with purpose :
* To populate and defend areas of the world (ecological presence).
* To challenge players with varied combat mechanics.
* To serve as sources of loot, crafting materials, and progression.
* To reinforce the identity and difficulty curve of each continent and region.

	Progression is geographically gated : as players advance through continents and regions, monsters become progressively stronger, reflecting both level scaling 
and environmental difficulty. In many cases, outdoor zones themselves require party play, especially when players first arrive with low-tier equipment. This ensures
a natural sense of danger and pushes cooperative gameplay, even outside of dungeons.

	Unlike static NPCs, monsters operate under mechanics-driven systems (aggro, perception, environment integration, threat handling, etc.) that scale in complexity
depending on their type, rank, and location.

---

		Key Differences Between Monsters
	Not all monsters are created equal. Their design and mechanics scale with type, location, and player progression.

1. Rank / Power Level
	* Common mobs : Designed for grinding/quests, manageable solo.
	* Elites : Stronger, often requiring coordination, especially in early regions.
	* Rare mobs : Unique spawns with special loot.
	* Bosses / World Bosses : Encounter-defining enemies with scripted mechanics.

2. Regional Progression
	* Monsters are tiered by continent and region, creating a natural progression curve.
	* Each new area introduces higher-level monsters, often with new mechanics or resistances.
	* Outdoor zones are not always solo-friendly — group play is often required for survival and efficient farming.
	* Monster strength is balanced against expected player gear progression, ensuring that undergeared adventurers feel pressure to cooperate.

3. Purpose in the World
	* Filler mobs : Populate ecosystems and provide grinding value.
	* Quest mobs : Directly tied to narrative or progression objectives.
	* Special mobs : Spawn under unique conditions (time, events, weather).

4. Behavioral Complexity
	* Passive : Do not attack unless provoked.
	* Aggressive : Attack on sight, within perception/aggro range.
	* Conditional : Triggered by noise, time, player actions, or scripted scenarios.

5. Reward Scaling
	* Drop rates, loot timers, and corpse persistence scale with monster rank and type.
	* Certain regions introduce rarer loot tables, incentivizing progression into more dangerous zones.
	* Group-oriented monsters often yield more rewarding or unique resources.

---

		Monster Categories

	Monsters are divided into broad categories that define how they behave and how players interact with them. Categories are further influenced by region and 
continent progression, making the same type of monster feel different across the world.

* Common Monsters
	* Found throughout all regions.
	* Quick kills, low loot, essential for grinding and resource farming.
	* Outdoor common mobs may still require grouping in higher-level regions due to raw difficulty.

* Elite Creatures
	* Stronger than normal monsters, often acting as zone “mini-bosses.”
	* Frequently placed in outdoor camps where solo players struggle.
	* Expanded mechanics: crowd-control resistance, larger aggro ranges, higher HP.

* Rare Monsters
	* Unique spawns with long respawn timers or special environmental triggers.
	* Drop cosmetic items, unique loot, or rare crafting materials.
	* Higher chance of appearing in remote regions or dangerous areas.

* Boss Monsters
	* Encounter-based enemies with scripted phases and mechanics.
	* Found in dungeons, raids, or special outdoor lairs.
	* Require group coordination, sometimes scaling difficulty depending on party size.

* World Bosses
	* Large-scale threats requiring multiple parties.
	* Highly visible with announcements or environmental changes upon spawn.
	* Drop structured loot for many players, with shared/distributed loot rules.

* Night Monsters (Conditional)
	* Appear only at night or in specific weather conditions.
	* Stronger and more aggressive than daytime counterparts.
	* Reinforce the danger of exploration in outdoor nighttime gameplay.

* Notorious Monsters (NM)
	* Rare, event-driven spawns with unique loot.
	* Serve as prestige challenges rewarding persistence and scouting.
	* Found across continents, often with spawn mechanics tied to regional lore.

* Skull Monsters
	* Marked with a skull icon instead of a level indicator.
	* Represent a massive gap in power — designed to discourage farming by underleveled players.
	* Often found guarding transition points between regions or continents.

		Perception Mechanics

	Monsters in World Game rely on multiple perception systems to detect, track, and react to players, NPCs, and environmental stimuli. This section outlines **how 
monsters sense their surroundings, make decisions, and prioritize threats, forming the basis for their AI behavior.

---

	1. Senses

	Monsters have individual senses that determine their ability to detect players or other entities. Each sense can be scaled by rank, type, and environmental 
conditions.

	a. Vision
	
* Line-of-Sight (LOS) : Monsters can detect players or entities only within their visual range. Obstructions such as walls,trees, or terrain features may block LOS.
* Sight Radius : Determines how far a monster can see.
	* Rank I: ~5 meters
	* Rank II: ~10 meters
	* Rank III: ~15 meters
	* Rank IV: ~20 meters
	* Rank V: ~30+ meters
* Peripheral Vision Angle : Defines how wide a monster can see (e.g., 90° for basic mobs, 120°+ for elite or boss monsters).
* Day/Night Vision Variance : Some monsters have enhanced vision at night or in dark zones (e.g., Shadow or Undead types) while others may be blinded by bright 
light.
* Color & Motion Detection : Higher-rank monsters may detect movement first, then stationary players, encouraging stealth mechanics for players.

	b. Hearing

* Monsters can detect players through sound. Key triggers include:
	* Footsteps (walking, running, swimming)
	* Jumping or falling
	* Attack sounds (melee swings, spellcasting)
	* Loot collection or environmental interactions
* Hearing Radius scales with rank and type.
	* Coward or Ranger monsters often have larger hearing ranges to trigger flee mechanics.
* Hearing can override LOS in some monsters, making stealth or silence-based mechanics effective against low-rank mobs.

	c. Smell / Tracking

* Certain monsters (especially Beast and Animal types) can detect players using **scent or pheromones**.
	* Can track players through terrain or cover.
	* Smell radius may increase when the player is bleeding, poisoned, or carrying items like meat or herbs.
	* Rank III+ monsters may ignore cover partially and pursue based on scent trails.

	d. Magic Detection

* Some monsters can sense magical presence or casting.
	* Detects players using healing, buffs, or offensive spells.
	* Certain Esoteric or Elemental monsters can prioritize magic users as primary targets.

---

	2. Aggro and Threat Mechanics

	Threat is dynamic, and monsters use it to select targets. Aggro is influenced by proximity, damage received, healing, and noise.

	a. Proximity Aggro

* Monsters target players entering their detection radius.
* Radius varies by rank, type, and environmental conditions:
	* Dense forests or urban areas may reduce LOS but not hearing.
* High-rank monsters may have pre-aggro zones : players entering a wider “suspicious” radius may be observed before engagement.

	b. Damage-Triggered Aggro

* Monsters immediately target attackers.
* Threshold scales by rank :
	* Rank I-II: Only respond to meaningful damage
	* Rank III-V: Aggro at minimal damage

	c. Healing / Buff Aggro

* Certain monsters can detect healing or buffs.
	* Encourages players to position healers strategically.
	* Elite monsters may cast interrupt or silence abilities upon detecting healing.

	d. Noise-Based Threat

* Players generate noise via movement, attacking, or environmental interaction.
* Monsters may investigate noise first, then visually confirm targets.
* Some monsters have alert states :
	* Investigating noise: slower movement, cautious patrol
	* Confirmed target: normal or berserk movement

---

	3. Patrolling and Investigation Patterns

* Fixed Paths : Patrol predetermined routes; engagement occurs if a player crosses path.
* Randomized Movement : Roams an area unpredictably; increases exploration tension.
* Investigation Behavior :
	* After hearing or detecting a disturbance, monster may:
		* Move to last known location of player
		* Search nearby area for 5–10 seconds (Rank-dependent)
		* Return to patrol if nothing found

---

	4. Group Dynamics

* High-rank monsters often operate in coordinated groups :
	* Reinforcements : Invoker monsters can summon additional mobs.
	* Aggression Cascade : When one monster is attacked, nearby allies increase aggressiveness.
	* Leadership Influence : Leader mobs (Rank III+) can buff or direct nearby minions.

---

	5. Retreat and Desperation

* Monsters may change behavior when HP falls below thresholds :
	* Rage Mode : Increased movement speed, damage, or skill usage
	* Flee: Coward or Ranger monsters attempt to escape
	* Tactical Retreat: Elite monsters may reposition behind obstacles or summon reinforcements

---

	6. Environmental Integration
	
	Monsters interact with terrain and environmental conditions:

* Terrain types affect movement speed (swim, jump, climb, run)
* Weather may impair vision/hearing
* Monsters may use terrain for ambush or cover
* Environmental hazards can trigger monster reactions (fire, traps, collapsing structures)

---

	7. Alert and Suspicion States

	Monsters have multi-tier perception states :

1. Idle : Not aware of players
2. Suspicious : Detected noise or minor movement
3. Alert : Visual or magic detection confirmed
4. Aggressive : Engages player; uses full AI
5. Rage Mode / Retreat : Low HP triggers strategic fallback

	Each state influences movement, attack choice, and group behavior.

---

	8. Special Senses / Abilities (Optional)

* Thermal or Infrared Sensing : Detects heat signatures (e.g., fire-elemental or undead monsters)
* Echolocation / Sonar : Blind monsters (like bats) detect via sound
* Aura Detection : High-tier monsters sense magical auras, buffs, or debuffs
* Territoriality : Monsters patrol their home zone and will ignore outsiders until provoked

---

		Behaviour Mechanics

	Monsters in World Game display dynamic behavior based on their perception, rank, type, and environmental context. This section outlines combat and non-combat 
actions, movement, attack logic, and AI patterns.

---

	1. Movement Mechanics

	Monsters’ movement types determine how they traverse the environment,pursue players, or position themselves strategically. Movement is influenced by rank, type,
environment, and combat state.

* Movement Types

  * Walk : Standard patrol or idle movement
  * Run / Chase : Triggered by aggro; speed scales with rank and type
  * Sprint / Charge : Short bursts of high speed, often used by Berserk or Assassin archetypes
  * Swim : Aquatic monsters can traverse water bodies
  * Jump / Climb : Used to navigate obstacles or reach player positions
  * Teleport / Blink (rare): For elite or boss monsters only

* Movement Modifiers

  * Terrain penalties: mud, sand, snow, ice reduce speed
  * Environmental hazards: fire, spikes, or falling rocks can trigger avoidance or reroute AI
  * Rage Mode: +10–50% movement speed depending on rank

---

	2. Combat Archetypes

	Monsters are designed with archetypal combat roles to create diverse encounters and tactical challenges.

1. Melee / Bruiser

   * Engages players up close
   * Uses high damage attacks or crowd control (CC)
   * Typically low mobility but high HP and defense

2. Ranged / Archer / Caster

   * Attacks from a distance
   * Uses projectiles or spells
   * Prioritizes positioning and often avoids direct melee

3. Tank / Protector

   * High HP and defense, designed to absorb damage
   * Often leads groups, drawing player attention
   * Can use taunt-like abilities to force player focus

4. Assassin / Skirmisher

   * High mobility, low HP
   * Focuses on burst damage and target priority
   * Can retreat or reposition quickly if threatened

5. Berserk / Rage Dealer

   * Damage output increases as HP decreases
   * May trigger Rage Mode automatically
   * Often has reckless movement and ignores threats

6. Invoker / Summoner

   * Calls minions or additional monsters
   * Combines ranged or melee attacks with summoning
   * Requires multi-layered strategies to defeat

7. Coward / Flee Specialist

   * Avoids direct combat
   * Can alert nearby monsters while retreating
   * Often triggers traps or ambush mechanics

---

	3. Attack Patterns

	Monsters use adaptive combat behavior, reacting to players and the environment:

* Target Selection

  * Based on threat ranking : damage received, perceived danger (healing, buffs), and proximity
  * Elite monsters may prioritize ranged or magic users first

* Skill Usage

  * Low-rank monsters: basic melee or ranged attacks
  * Mid-rank: adds DoTs, slows, stuns, or knockbacks
  * High-rank / bosses: complex combos, area-of-effect (AoE), and CC chains

* Attack Phases

  * Normal Phase : Standard attack rotation
  * Rage Mode Phase : Enhanced attack speed, damage, or additional abilities when HP < threshold
  * Phase Transitions : Bosses may unlock new abilities after specific conditions

---

	4. Defensive Behavior

* Evasion / Dodge : Some monsters may sidestep attacks (especially Assassins or Ranged types)
* Block / Shield : Tanks or humanoid elites can reduce incoming damage
* Regeneration / Vampiric Healing : Drains HP from players or recovers naturally
* Terrain Use : Monsters may retreat behind obstacles or utilize high ground

---

	5. Group Combat Behavior

* Coordinated Attacks : Leader-type monsters may synchronize attacks or CC with nearby mobs
* Reinforcement Calls : High-rank monsters can summon help or trigger nearby spawners
* Aggression Cascade : When one monster is attacked, nearby monsters increase their threat or enter alert mode

---

	6. Ranged / Melee Interactions

* Melee monsters close the distance aggressively
* Ranged monsters kite players and use terrain to maintain distance
* Hybrid monsters may switch between melee and ranged based on target proximity

---

	7. Environmental Awareness

* Monsters react to terrain, traps, and hazards
* Certain monsters avoid environmental damage (fire, water) or exploit terrain for attacks
* Patrol and combat paths can be altered dynamically if environmental obstacles appear

---

	8. Rage Mode Mechanics

* Activated automatically below a rank-specific HP threshold
* Increases movement speed, attack speed, damage, and ability usage
* Can trigger special skills or AI changes
* Rank V monsters may display telegraphed attack signals before executing large Rage Mode abilities

---

	9. Idle and Non-Combat Behavior

* Idle Animation : Resting, wandering, or interacting with environment
* Environmental Reactions : Monsters may react to fire, traps, falling debris, or magical auras
* Player Interaction : Non-aggro monsters may observe players and enter Suspicious state before Aggression

---

	10. Special Mechanics

* Ambush / Surprise Attacks : Some monsters can hide and strike when a player enters proximity
* Crowd Control (CC) Usage : Stuns, slows, silences, and knockbacks used strategically
* Lootability Awareness : Monsters may pause movement briefly if being looted (more for bosses or elite mobs)

---

		THREAT & AGGRO RULES

	Monsters in World Game use dynamic threat and aggro systems to prioritize targets and maintain combat challenge. The system combines proximity, actions, 
abilities, and group dynamics to determine monster behavior.

---

	1. Basic Aggro Mechanics

	Aggro determines which player a monster attacks first. Each monster maintains a threat table recording perceived danger from players.

* Aggro Triggers

	1. Proximity : Entering a monster's aggro radius initiates combat. Radius scales by:
		* Rank (Rank I: small, Rank V: very large)
		* Monster type (Patrols may have smaller radius than Invokers)
	2. Damage Received : Monsters prioritize players dealing the highest damage. Thresholds scale by monster rank.
	3. Healing Aggro : Healers may generate threat if using strong healing on allies. Some elite monsters can detect and target healers first.
	4. Buff / Debuff Actions : Using offensive buffs (damage increase, attack speed) or debuffs (slow, poison) can increase threat.

---

	2. Threat Table

* Each player has a threat score that monsters calculate continuously during combat.
* Formula (simplified) :

```
Threat = DamageDone * DamageWeight + HealingDone * HealingWeight + BuffDebuffEffect * EffectWeight
```

* Weights scale by monster rank/type

	* Rank I-II: DamageWeight dominant, ignore buffs/debuffs
	* Rank III-IV: Balanced calculation including buffs, debuffs, healing
	* Rank V (World Bosses): Complex calculation including distance, role, environmental effects, special mechanics

* Threat Table Features

	* Can track multiple targets simultaneously
	* Dynamically updates in real-time as players act
	* Determines primary target (highest threat) and secondary targets

---

	3. Target Prioritization

* Monsters may switch targets based on updated threat scores
* High-rank monsters may intentionally target weaker players or healers to disrupt the group
* Specialized archetypes (Assassins, Ranged DPS) can override normal threat behavior

	Example Priority Rules :

1. Healers if they buff high damage dealers
2. High damage melee characters
3. Squishy ranged players
4. Tanks, if they fail to generate sufficient threat

---

	4. Aggro Radius and Engagement

* Base Aggro Radius : Varies by rank/type, e.g.,
	* Rank I: 5–10 meters
	* Rank II: 10–15 meters
	* Rank III-IV: 15–25 meters
	* Rank V: 25+ meters

* Environmental Modifiers :
	* Dense terrain or obstacles can reduce effective aggro radius
	* Patrol monsters may have reduced radius on fixed paths but increase once provoked

---

	5. Threat Decay

* Threat from a player gradually decreases over time if they stop attacking, healing, or applying buffs/debuffs
* Ensures monsters can switch targets if a new player enters combat or becomes more threatening

---

	6. Multi-Target Combat

* Monsters can engage multiple players based on secondary threat thresholds
* Rank III-IV monsters may attack the top 2–3 threat holders
* Rank V bosses may have mechanics that split attention or prioritize role-based threat (e.g., healer first, DPS second)

---

	7. Special Aggro Mechanics

* Rage Mode Threat Spike : When a monster enters Rage Mode, threat calculations may reset or temporarily favor **players dealing the most recent damage**
* Taunt/Provocation : Some monsters can be temporarily forced to attack a specific target using player abilities
* Proximity Chain Aggro : If one monster is attacked, nearby monsters within X meters may automatically gain partial threat from that attack

---

	8. Threat Feedback Indicators

* Monsters can telegraph target selection using:
	* Visual cues: glowing eyes, highlighted target indicator
	* Audio cues: roar, battle cry, spell chanting
	* Movement: sudden charge or turning towards the primary threat

---

	9. Loot and Aggro Integration

* Monsters that can be looted may remain aggressive until looted or defeated
* Some elite monsters have looting vulnerability : players with highest threat receive first access to loot

---

		ENVIRONMENT INTEGRATION

	Monsters in World Game do not exist in isolation. Their behavior, abilities, movement, and perception are influenced by their surroundings. Integrating 
environment mechanics increases immersion, strategic gameplay, and realism.

---

	1. Biome and Region Influence

* Each monster is tied to specific biomes or regions, which affects its:
	* Elemental affinity
	* Aggro radius
	* Abilities and resistances
	* Loot table variations

	Examples :
* Frozen Territory : Monsters have high resistance to Ice damage but are weak to Fire. Movement is slower unless adapted (e.g., wolves).
* Desert Regions : Monsters may gain speed buffs during the day and decreased HP regeneration.
* Underworld : Dark-affinity monsters have enhanced perception in darkness but reduced accuracy in bright areas.
* Dynamic Difficulty Scaling :
	* Monsters in new zones for players are stronger relative to the players’ current gear/level.
	* Outdoor areas may require party coordination against higher-rank monsters, similar to Metin2.

---

	2. Terrain Interaction

* Movement Adaptation :
	* Walk, Run, Swim, Climb, Jump mechanics based on monster type
	* Some monsters ignore terrain penalties (e.g., flying creatures)

* Line of Sight :
	* Monsters cannot see or target players behind obstacles unless specialized (e.g., “Tracker” monsters)

* Patrol Path Integration :
  * Monsters with patrol behavior adapt their route to terrain
  * Obstacles, bridges, cliffs, and water bodies affect patrol efficiency and aggro initiation

---

	3. Weather and Time Effects

* Monsters respond to environmental conditions dynamically:
	* Rain : Reduces ranged attack accuracy for outdoor monsters
	* Fog : Decreases detection radius for most monsters, except Shadow and Esoteric types
	* Night : Some monsters (e.g., Vampiric or Undead) gain stealth and enhanced perception
	* Daylight : Certain monsters (e.g., Holy, Animal) are more active or aggressive during day

---

	4. Interactive Objects and Zones

* Monsters may interact with specific environmental objects :
	* Trees / Rocks / Water bodies : Use as cover, ambush points, or obstacles
	* Mystic Stones / Altars / Shrines : Protect, spawn reinforcements, or gain temporary buffs
	* Hazard Zones : Lava, quicksand, spikes that can damage both players and monsters, forcing repositioning

* Spawn Points and Zones :
	* Certain monsters spawn only in triggered environmental conditions
	* Example: Fire-elemental monsters appear near volcano vents, Water-elementals near rivers/lakes

---

	5. Environmental Triggers

* Monsters may react to player-triggered environmental events :
	* Player opening chests or interacting with objects may summon nearby monsters
	* Breaking barriers or entering restricted zones may trigger ambush mechanics
	* Certain monsters gain temporary buffs when environmental triggers occur (e.g., Storm Elementals in lightning storms)

---

	6. Environmental Awareness in AI

* Pathfinding and Obstacle Avoidance :
	* Monsters use terrain-aware pathfinding to navigate around obstacles
	* Flying monsters ignore ground obstacles but may avoid restricted air zones

* Environmental Advantage Mechanics :
	* Monsters may position themselves to gain buffs from the environment :
		* Fire monsters near flames get attack bonus
		* Water monsters in rivers get speed bonus

* Adaptive Combat :
	* Monsters may retreat or reposition to terrain that gives tactical advantage
	* Bosses may move around the battlefield to avoid harmful terrain effects or leverage advantageous spots

---

	7. Dynamic Environmental Combat Events

* High-rank monsters or bosses may alter the environment during combat :
	* Summon hazards: fire pools, falling rocks, ice spikes
	* Change lighting: darkness zones, blinding effects
	* Trigger environmental buffs/debuffs for themselves or players

* Example:
	* Rank V Volcano Dragon : Raises lava walls, creating temporary zones that damage players while buffing itself with Fire affinity

---

	8. Integration with Other Mechanics

* Perception Mechanics : Environmental factors like fog, darkness, or obstacles influence detection radius and senses
* Threat & Aggro Rules : Aggro may be modified by terrain positioning (higher ground advantage) or obstacles
* Behavior Mechanics : Monsters may patrol differently or retreat to environmental cover

---

		TAG SYSTEM (Mechanics)

	The Tag System is a set of labels or attributes assigned to monsters that influence behavior, combat interactions, loot eligibility, and environmental 
adaptation. Tags are modular, meaning one monster can have multiple tags that dynamically interact with its AI and player encounters.

---

	1. Purpose of Tags

* Tags allow the same monster base to behave differently depending on context, rank, or environment.
* Tags affect:
	* Aggro behavior and perception
	* Combat style (melee, ranged, hybrid)
	* Loot eligibility and timing
	* Environmental interactions
	* Movement and chase patterns

---

	2. Core Monster Tags

1. Aggression Tags

	* Passive : Does not attack unless provoked; low aggro radius
	* Defensive : Attacks only when a player is within melee range or damages it

---

	3. Chase Mechanics Integration

* Chase Distance (Max Pursuit Radius) :
	* Monsters will only pursue players within a set distance from their original spawn point
	* If the player moves beyond this radius, the monster returns to its spawn point
	* Distance can scale with:
		* Monster rank (higher-rank monsters chase farther)
		* Monster type (Tanky or Aggressive types chase further than Coward or Passive types)
		* Environment (open plains vs confined dungeon)
		* Keep receiving damage while chasing, increase the lenght of chasing for some monsters, such Leaders, Bosses, WB, NM.
		
	Example Distances :

* Rank I: 5–10 meters
* Rank II: 10–20 meters
* Rank III: 20–40 meters
* Rank IV: 50–80 meters
* Rank V: 100+ meters
	
	Return Behavior :

* Pathfinding-aware return to original spawn
* Monster may recover health or reset abilities while returning

---

	4. Tag Interactions

* Tags combine to define complex behavior:
	* Example 1: *Aggressive + Ranged + Tracker + Terrain Adaptive* → A ranged monster that chases players intelligently, avoiding terrain penalties, and actively 
tracks hidden or stealthy players
	* Example 2: *Coward + Melee + Lootable + Rage Mode* → A melee monster that flees under pressure but becomes more dangerous in low HP situations

* Event-Driven Tags :
	* Some tags activate dynamically depending on the environment, player actions, or health thresholds
	* Example: *Ambush Predator + Night Vision* triggers only at night

---

	5. Implementation Notes

* Tags are modular and extensible; new tags can be added without rewriting AI
* Tags integrate with:
	* Perception System : Modify detection and reaction radius
	* Behavior Mechanics : Adjust patrols, retreat, and skill usage
	* Threat & Aggro Rules : Influence which players are targeted and how long pursuit lasts
	* Loot Table & Timed Loot : Define loot availability and distribution

		Monster Loot Table and Drop Mechanics

	Monsters in World Game have a structured loot system designed to reward players fairly while encouraging group play and strategic engagement. The system 
integrates rank, type, faction, quest, and timed looting mechanics.

---

	1. Loot Categories

	1.1 Common Loot

* Dropped by lower-ranked monsters (Rank I–II).
* Typically consists of basic consumables, crafting materials, and starter gear.
* Examples : Healing potions, copper ore, low-level cloth armor, beginner crafting tools.
* Drop Rate : High (70–100% for Rank I, 50–80% for Rank II).

	1.2 Uncommon Loot

* Dropped by medium-ranked monsters (Rank II–III).
* Slightly rarer items or higher-quality materials than common loot.
* Examples : Lesser enchantment stones, refined gems, mid-tier weapons and armor.
* Drop Rate : Medium (25–50%).

	1.3 Rare Loot

* Dropped by high-ranked monsters (Rank III–IV).
* Unique items that offer significant benefits or upgrades.
* Examples : High-quality weapons, advanced consumables like Elixirs of Power, rare cosmetic items.
* Drop Rate : Low (10–25%).

	1.4 Epic Loot

* Dropped by top-ranking monsters (Rank V and World Bosses).
* Powerful items and legendary crafting components.
* Examples : Legendary weapons, high-grade armor sets, Emberstones, Runes of Power.
* Drop Rate : Very low (5–10%).

	1.5 Legendary Loot

* Exclusive drops from Legendary Monsters, World Bosses, or significant event monsters.
* Highly coveted items providing substantial combat, crafting, or exploration advantages.
* Examples : Blades of the Fallen, god-tier armor, unique crafting blueprints like Forge of the Immortal.
* Drop Rate : Extremely low (1–5%).

	1.6 Faction Loot

* Dropped by monsters tied to specific factions.
* Includes faction-specific relics, crafting components, or insignia.
* Examples : Outlaw Tokens, Faction Medals, Guild Enchanted Artifacts.
* Drop Rate : Moderate (20–40%).

	1.7 Quest-Related Loot

* Drops that are mandatory for story or faction quests.
* Examples : Ancient Rune Fragments, Quest Medals, Sacred Scrolls.
* Drop Rate : Guaranteed or high probability for quest completion purposes.

---

	2. Loot Timers and Availability

* Monsters remain lootable for a duration based on their rank, after which their loot disappears:
	* Rank I : 5–10 seconds
	* Rank II : 10–20 seconds
	* Rank III : 20–30 seconds
	* Rank IV : 40–60 seconds
	* Rank V / World Boss : 60–120 seconds

* Mechanics :
	* A monster’s corpse is interactable only within the timer.
	* Loot visibility can be conditional on player proximity or group presence.
	* Loot may disappear if the monster is aggressively reset by respawning mechanics.

---

	3. Loot Distribution Mechanics

* In group or raid encounters, loot can be distributed via:
	* Performance-Based Loot : Damage dealt, healing contributed, or tanking threat determines loot priority.
	* Role-Based Loot : Tanks receive defensive gear, damage-dealers offensive items, and support classes utility or healing-enhancing items.
	* Randomized Loot (Need/Greed system): Players roll for rare items.

* Shared Loot Mechanics :
	* Loot table for group instances can be shared or personal :
		* Shared: Only one player can loot each item, with drops divided based on performance.
		* Personal: Each player receives their own loot roll, but drop rarity scales with monster rank.

---

	4. Rank-Based Loot Scaling

* Monster rank determines loot quality, quantity, and loot table richness :
	* Rank I : Basic items, consumables, and common crafting materials.
	* Rank II : Adds uncommon crafting components, moderate-value gear.
	* Rank III : Rare materials, advanced consumables, and mid-tier unique weapons.
	* Rank IV : Epic gear, top-tier consumables, and rare crafting components.
	* Rank V / Legendary : Legendary items, multiple loot rolls, and potentially unique quest drops.

* Loot Multipliers :
	* Certain tags (e.g., Boss, Elite, Invoker) increase loot drops or quality.
	* Player-specific buffs (e.g., Luck, Drop Boost) can also modify loot chances.

---

	5. Environmental and Special Loot Modifiers

* Certain regions or environments influence loot tables:
	* Dungeon monsters : Higher chance of rare or epic loot.
	* Outdoor wilderness monsters : Common and uncommon loot is prevalent; rare drops are extremely low.
	* Event monsters / Seasonal mobs : Special loot drops tied to events or world events.

* Special Monster Mechanics :
	* Invoker / Spawner Monsters : Can drop additional loot for summoned creatures if killed.
	* Rage Mode / Desperation Phase : May temporarily increase drop quality if killed during this phase.

---

	6. Integration with Lootability Tags

* All loot tables are integrated with Lootable / Timed Loot tags from the Tag System.
* Timers, rarity, and eligibility are defined per monster type, rank, and tag.
* Enables dynamic loot interactions based on monster state, combat phase, and environment.

---

	7. Loot Table Examples (Structured)

```lua
LootTable = {
    RankI = { Common = {"Copper Ore", "Healing Potion"}, Uncommon = {}, Rare = {}, Epic = {}, Legendary = {} },
    RankII = { Common = {"Iron Ore"}, Uncommon = {"Lesser Enchantment Stone"}, Rare = {}, Epic = {}, Legendary = {} },
    RankIII = { Common = {"Silver Ore"}, Uncommon = {"Refined Gems"}, Rare = {"Elixir of Power"}, Epic = {}, Legendary = {} },
    RankIV = { Common = {}, Uncommon = {"High-tier Gear"}, Rare = {"Legendary Weapon"}, Epic = {"Emberstone"}, Legendary = {} },
    RankV = { Common = {}, Uncommon = {}, Rare = {"Epic Gear"}, Epic = {"Runes of Power"}, Legendary = {"Blades of the Fallen"} }
}
```

* This allows dynamic assignment, easy extension for faction loot, quest items, or event-specific drops.

---

		Movement & Combat Archetypes

	1. Movement Mechanics

	Monsters in World Game have different movement types that affect exploration, combat, and AI behavior. Movement speed and type may vary based on rank, terrain,
status effects, and archetype.

* Walk : Default low-speed movement. Used by passive or patrol monsters.
* Run : Standard movement for chasing or engaging players. Speed scales with rank and archetype (e.g., Rank V monsters are faster than Rank I).
* Sprint (Burst Movement) : Short-term high-speed movement, often triggered in Rage Mode or special attacks.
* Jump / Leap : Monsters may jump over obstacles or leap towards players to close distance. High-rank monsters can use jumping for tactical advantage.
* Swim : Used by aquatic or amphibious monsters; speed varies by species and terrain type.
* Climb / Fly *(optional for specialized monsters)* : Certain elite or world boss monsters can climb surfaces or fly, bypassing terrain restrictions.

	Movement Modifiers :

* Terrain: Monsters move slower in difficult terrain (mud, snow, water).
* Status Effects: Slows, stuns, roots, or fear reduce movement speed or lock movement.
* Group Dynamics: Reinforcements or coordinated attacks may move faster to catch up with allies.

	Chase Distance :

* Monsters track players for a limited distance from their spawn point.
* Rank I & II: 5–10 meters.
* Rank III: 10–20 meters.
* Rank IV: 20–40 meters.
* Rank V & World Bosses: Up to 60 meters or area-wide (outdoor).
* If players escape beyond this distance, monsters return to original spawn after a “return timer” (scaled by rank).

---

	2. Combat Archetypes

	Monsters adopt combat archetypes that define their preferred fighting style, abilities, and AI priorities.

| Archetype     | Description                        | Typical Abilities / Behavior                                        | Rank Range |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Tank**      | Absorbs damage and controls aggro. | High HP, defense boosts, crowd-control, protects allies.            | III–V      |
| **Assassin**  | Focuses on quick kills.            | High damage, stealth or burst skills, targets low-HP players first. | II–V       |
| **Melee**     | Close-range attacker.              | Standard attacks, occasional abilities like knockback or stun.      | I–V        |
| **Ranger**    | Ranged attacker.                   | Attacks from distance, kiting AI, uses poison or DoT effects.       | II–V       |
| **Berserk**   | Gains power at low HP.             | Rage Mode activation, damage amplification, sometimes AoE effects.  | III–V      |
| **Vampiric**  | Life-stealing combat style.        | Drains health, mana, or stamina from players.                       | III–V      |
| **Invoker**   | Summons reinforcements.            | Spawns additional mobs or minions on damage thresholds.             | III–V      |
| **God**       | Attack speed increases at low HP.  | Critical skill timing, rapid attacks, can stack with Berserk.       | IV–V       |
| **Coward**    | Fleeing behavior.                  | Escapes when low HP, triggers chase or trap mechanics.              | I–III      |
| **Patrol**    | Area control.                      | Moves along set routes, engages on line-of-sight.                   | I–IV       |
| **Skillable** | Uses advanced abilities.           | Spells, buffs/debuffs, AoE attacks, conditional AI logic.           | II–V       |
| **Spawner**   | Summons additional monsters.       | Limited to Mystic Stones or specific elite mobs.                    | III–V      |

	Combat Behavior Notes :

* Archetypes determine AI targeting priorities, e.g., Tank targets the nearest threat or heals, Assassin targets squishy players first.
* Certain archetypes can combine : e.g., a Tank + Skillable monster can defend allies while using AoE attacks.
* Rage Mode (Desperation Phase) may trigger temporary changes in archetype behavior, like Berserk monsters doubling attack speed or Assassins gaining temporary stealth.

---

	3. Integrating Movement and Combat

* Archetype AI dictates movement decisions: e.g., Rangers maintain distance, Melee monsters close gap.
* Movement and combat archetypes work together with Perception Mechanics : monsters detect players by proximity, line-of-sight, or specific senses.
* Group dynamics can alter archetype behavior temporarily: e.g., a Berserk monster may trigger other nearby monsters to enter aggressive mode.

---

	4. Special Considerations

* Environmental Adaptation : Some archetypes modify movement based on terrain: aquatic monsters swim, flyers bypass obstacles.
* Loot Behavior : Higher-ranked monsters or certain archetypes (Spawner, God) may linger longer after death for looting.
* Status Interactions : Debuffs like Root, Fear, or Slow directly modify movement and archetype effectiveness.

---

		Special Senses & Perception Mechanics

	Monsters in World Game are not just “seeing” players—they have layered perception systems that define how, when, and why they detect targets. Perception 
mechanics influence aggro, movement decisions, and combat behavior.

---

	1. Base Perception

	All monsters have basic perception that determines when they engage players:

* Proximity Detection : Default aggro when a player comes within a fixed radius (scaled by Rank and archetype).
* Line-of-Sight (LOS) : Monsters must “see” a player to engage in combat. Obstacles such as walls, rocks, or terrain can block LOS.
* Noise Detection : Monsters may detect players through footsteps, spellcasting, or other loud actions. Noise radius scales by player activity and monster’s 
perception level.
* Damage Detection : Monsters react to taking damage from a player or environmental hazards. Higher-rank monsters may aggro even from minor attacks.

---

	2. Special Senses

	Certain monsters possess enhanced or unique senses that allow them to detect players in more complex ways:

1. Thermal / Heat Vision
	* Detects body heat in nearby players.
	* Particularly used by predators or nocturnal creatures.
	* Effective even in darkness, but impaired by environmental insulation (e.g., cold weather or cloaks).

2. Magic Sensitivity
	* Detects players casting spells or holding enchanted items.
	* Scales with monster archetype: Skillable, Vampiric, and God monsters have higher sensitivity.

3. Sound Sensitivity
	* Reacts to loud actions like sprinting, jumping, or using AoE abilities.
	* Coward and Ranger archetypes often have acute sound detection, triggering retreats or ranged attacks.

4. Smell / Scent Tracking
	* Monsters track players by scent, particularly in forests, jungles, or open areas.
	* Higher-ranked monsters may retain scent for longer distances.
	* Some monsters can distinguish between player ranks, health status, or faction through scent.

5. Vibration / Ground Sensitivity
	* Detects movements through environmental vibrations (e.g., running on bridges or stomping).
	* Particularly effective for Earth element monsters or high-mass creatures.

---

	3. Perception Modifiers

	Monster perception is influenced by environmental, player, and monster-specific factors :

* Environment Factors :
	* Darkness reduces visual detection but may enhance smell or thermal detection.
	* Fog, rain, snow, or sandstorms can reduce LOS and perception radius.

* Player Stealth & Skills :
	* Players can use stealth, invisibility, or environmental camouflage to reduce detection chances.
	* Noise suppression skills or magical cloaking reduce sound and magic detection.

* Monster Status :
	* Injured or enraged monsters (Rage Mode) may have heightened perception.
	* Tired or slowed monsters may have reduced perception.

---

	4. Perception Integration with AI

	Monsters use perception to make decisions:

* Target Prioritization : Based on detected players, perception type, and threat levels (e.g., closest, healer, or highest damage).
* Alert States :
	* Idle : Monster wanders or patrols, basic perception active.
	* Suspicious : Monster detected faint signals (sound, vibration) but has not fully aggroed.
	* Aggressive : Player fully detected; monster engages based on archetype.
	* Rage Mode : High-rank or low-HP monsters enhance all senses, widening detection radius and attack efficiency.
* Group Awareness : Certain monsters can alert nearby allies when they detect a player, enabling coordinated attacks or ambushes.

---

	5. Environmental Interaction

* Monsters react to environmental changes detected via senses:
	* Traps : Smell, vibration, or psychic awareness may trigger evasion or avoidance.
	* Terrain Obstacles : Line-of-sight and sound may be blocked by walls, water, or trees.
	* Player Positioning : Monsters detect when players attempt flanking, hiding, or ranged harassment.

---

	6. Special Cases & Rare Mechanics

* Elite or Legendary Monsters may have multi-layered senses, detecting players with multiple modalities (e.g., magic + scent + vibration) simultaneously.
* Mystic Stone / Spawner Monsters : Limited visual perception but highly sensitive to player proximity or disturbance.
* Adaptive AI : Some monsters learn from repeated encounters and gradually increase perception efficiency toward frequently used player tactics.

* Adaptive AI : Some monsters learn from repeated encounters, gradually improving perception against repeated tactics.

---

		Perception Mechanics Extra

	1. Aggro Mechanisms

* Proximity Aggro : Monsters detect players based on distance. Rank I-II monsters have small detection radii; Rank III-V monsters can sense players farther away.
* Damage-Triggered Aggro : Taking damage triggers immediate targeting. Stronger monsters react to minimal damage, weaker ones ignore minor hits.
* Healing Aggro : Monsters can detect and target healing actions from players nearby.
* Alert States :
	* *Idle:* Passive behavior, unaware of players.
	* *Suspicious:* Detected small stimuli (footsteps, minor damage), starts alert animation or movement.
	* *Aggressive:* Fully engages player with abilities.
	* *Rage Mode:* High-damage, high-speed phase when health is low (formerly “Desperation Phase”).

	2. Patrolling & Movement Patterns

* Fixed Paths : Monsters follow set patrol routes; crossing their path triggers aggro.
* Random Movement : Move randomly in a bounded area to create unpredictability.
* Chase Distance : Maximum distance monsters can chase a player from their spawn before returning. Varies by rank and type.
* Movement Types : Walk, run, swim, jump; movement speed varies by rank, type, and environmental conditions.

	3. Group Dynamics

* Reinforcements : Certain monsters summon nearby mobs or minions under specific conditions.
* Coordinated Attacks : Monsters react to each other’s states (e.g., Berserk triggering nearby allies).
* Rage Mode Activation : Low-health monsters increase aggression and skill usage.

	4. Retreat & Escape

* Rage Mode Mechanics : Monster may flee or reposition if specific conditions are met.
* Escape Behavior : Certain “Coward” or “Ranger” types attempt to flee; players may need to chase, trap, or CC them.

	5. Special Senses

* Visual Detection : Detects player movement, stealth modifiers, and camouflage.
* Auditory Detection : Reacts to player noise levels (spells, weapons, running).
* Thermal Detection : Detects warm-blooded players, especially in dark environments.
* Magic Detection : Detects active buffs, casting, or magical auras.
* Olfactory (Scent) Detection : Detects players via smell in forests, caves, or certain terrains.
* Vibration Detection : Senses player movement on fragile terrain, bridges, or loose ground.
* Psychic Detection : Rare monsters or elite bosses can anticipate player actions.

	6. Environmental Integration

* Terrain Influence : Dense foliage, water, and obstacles reduce monster detection effectiveness.
* Trap Awareness : Monsters can trigger or avoid traps if high enough intelligence.
* Day/Night Cycles : Some monsters more perceptive at certain times; nocturnal creatures have enhanced detection at night.

	7. Elite & Rare Mechanics

* Multi-layer Detection : World bosses or Legendary Monsters have overlapping detection types (visual + auditory + magical + psychic).
* Dynamic Alerting : Nearby elites can alert additional monsters if a player enters their territory.

	1. Taunt / Threat Modifiers (WoW-style)

* Certain monsters or bosses have explicit skills that modify threat or swap targets.
* *Use Cases:*
	* Tanks can generate high threat to control aggro.
	* Monsters can redirect attacks toward players with higher threat generation or specific actions (healing, damage burst).
* Threat modifiers can also scale with monster rank: Rank I monsters may ignore threat swaps, while Rank IV-V monsters actively target highest-threat players.

	2. Enrage Timers & Soft Enrage

* Enrage Timer : Bosses escalate damage, speed, or skill usage if the fight exceeds a certain time limit.
* Soft Enrage : Gradual increase in aggression or ability frequency, encouraging players to optimize fight efficiency.
* *Visual Indicators:* Aura, particle effects, or sound cues indicate the boss is entering enrage mode.

	3. Phased Encounters

* Bosses and elite monsters can transition through multiple phases, each with unique abilities and behavior.
* Phase changes can be triggered by:
	* HP thresholds (e.g., 75%, 50%, 25%)
	* Timed events (e.g., summoning minions after 1 minute)
	* Environmental triggers (e.g., crossing zones, activating crystals).
* Phases are telegraphed visually and mechanically, allowing players to adapt strategy.

	4. Tether / Leash Improvements

* Monsters have configurable leash mechanics:
	* Maximum chase distance from spawn.
	* Leash grace : slight tolerance before returning to original location.
	* Soft pullback behavior: monsters gradually return instead of instantly teleporting, avoiding “kite until leash” exploits.

	5. Loot Pity System

* Rare or epic loot drops can be modified with a pity system :
	* Guaranteed rare after N kills.
	* Weighted chance increases with consecutive failures.
* Can be applied differently for party vs solo play.

	6. Taming / Capture Mechanics

* Certain rare monsters can be tamed or captured for pets, mounts, or crafting companions.
* Mechanics include:
	* Capture attempt using consumables or skills.
	* Tiered success chance based on monster rank, health, or status effects.
	* Only one monster may be tamed per cooldown period to prevent farming abuse.

	7. Territory / Faction Control

* Spawn patterns can dynamically change based on faction control :
	* Faction A dominates area → Monster spawns favor that faction.
	* Neutral or contested areas spawn more aggressive or elite monsters.
* Provides a living world effect and strategic resource control.

	8. Dynamic Spawn Waves

* Noise, player actions, or events trigger short-term monster waves :
	* Dungeon or outdoor areas can dynamically escalate in difficulty.
	* Waves encourage coordinated player responses or tactical positioning.

	9. Stealth Counters

* Hidden or stealthy players can be detected by monsters using special mechanics:
	* Passive senses like scent, track tags, or vibration detection.
	* NPC companions (e.g., detection dogs) or environmental hazards reveal hidden players.
	* Elite monsters may ignore standard stealth entirely.

	10. Assist / Assist Limits

* When one monster assists another, propagation limits prevent runaway chain reactions:
	* Configurable number of assists in a group.
	* Certain monsters can trigger assist calls only under specific conditions (e.g., HP thresholds, nearby ally death).

		Other Mechanics (Expanded)

1. Adaptive Loot Scaling
	* Monster drops adjust dynamically based on party size or average player level.
	* Ensures fair rewards for both solo players and groups, scaling item rarity, quantity, and gold/experience awarded.
	* Works in combination with the “lootability” mechanic (loot timers, disappearing corpses).

2. Skill Learning / Mimicry
	* Rare or special monsters may temporarily mimic player abilities or spells.
	* Can be triggered under specific conditions, such as:
		* Monster reaching a certain HP threshold
		* Being attacked with a unique skill
		* Environmental triggers (zone events)
   * This mechanic adds unpredictability to encounters and encourages player strategy adjustments.

3. Seasonal / Event Modifiers
	* Certain monsters gain temporary abilities, buffs, or special loot during world events or seasonal activities.
	* Examples:
		* Fire elementals during a “Volcanic Festival” have increased AoE fire damage.
		* Undead mobs in a “Dark Harvest” event drop rare crafting materials.
	* These modifiers can be layered on top of regular AI behavior and loot tables.
