	Mini-Bosses and Their Role

- "Mini-Bosses" : Found in dungeons or as sub-bosses, these enemies are stronger than regular elite mobs but usually don't have the complex abilities of full bosses. They're considered intermediate challenges that prepare players for the main boss fights.
- "Loot and Immunities" : While mini-bosses may have smaller loot tables, they can still offer unique rewards. Some of them are also immune to certain types of crowd control, making them more difficult to handle.

	Boss Fights

The culmination of PvE gameplay in *World Game* revolves around boss fights, particularly those in dungeons and runs. These fights often require well-coordinated group efforts and can take several tries to learn.

1. "Three Types of Boss Fights" :
   - "Tank and Spank" : Focuses on a direct confrontation where players must absorb damage and deal it back.
   - "DPS Race" : The goal is to deal as much damage as possible before a time limit or specific event occurs.
   - "Battle for Survival" : These fights are more complex, requiring players to prioritize survival over dealing damage.

2. "Gear Check" : A "gear check" is a boss that requires players to have a certain level of equipment or strength to defeat. These bosses test the effectiveness of a group’s gear and might be less skillful but can still serve as progression gates.
