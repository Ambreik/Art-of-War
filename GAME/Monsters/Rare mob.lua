			Rare Mob Overview
	A "rare mob" is a special type of creature that exhibits unique characteristics and behavior compared to regular mobs. These mobs can vary in appearance, 
abilities, and other traits depending on the continent, region, or expansion in which they are found. Here are some of the defining traits of rare mobs:

	Key Characteristics
- "Increased Power" : Rare mobs typically have significantly more health and more powerful abilities than regular mobs of the same level. This makes them a substantial challenge for players to defeat.
- "Spawning Frequency" : Rare mobs spawn less frequently than regular mobs. They may take several hours to respawn, or they may have spawn conditions based on factors such as the number of other rare mobs alive in the zone. Some rares in dungeons may only spawn in a small percentage of instances.
- "Loot Drops" : Rare mobs are known to drop special loot, often with higher rarity compared to standard mobs. They drop items from the uncommon loot table or better, with low-level rare mobs sometimes dropping common loot. In "Middlean Islands," they drop only rare loot, which is bind on equip. Rare mobs found in dungeons may drop items that are bind on pickup.
- "Unique Abilities" : Rare mobs often have an extra skill or ability that distinguishes them from regular mobs, which can sometimes be inferred from their name. They typically have health and DPS comparable to a mob that is 3 levels higher.
- "Tameable" : Some rare mobs, especially those that are beasts or animals, can be tamed as pets or mounts. These mobs have a distinctive smoke effect around them and possess unique names that are specific only to that particular monster.
- "Rank III" : All rare mobs are classified as "Rank III", signifying their elevated difficulty and rarity.

	Additional Information
- "Not Quest Objectives" : Rare mobs are never the primary objective of quests, though they may drop items that start quests. They are often part of the open world, found in dungeons or specific areas, and not tied to any instance or specific questline.
- "Named Creatures" : Rare mobs are usually named, but not all named creatures are classified as rare.
- "Aggro and Combat" : Rare mobs may be found wandering in specific zones and are generally hostile. When encountered, they are substantial challenges for solo players or small groups due to their enhanced health and damage output.

	Loot and Rewards
- "Unique Loot" : Rare mobs drop unique items, often from the uncommon loot table or higher. These items are prized for their rarity and can be valuable to players seeking powerful gear.
- "Bind on Pickup vs. Bind on Equip" : Loot dropped by rare mobs can be either bind on pickup or bind on equip, depending on the region. This makes some rare loot highly sought after, as players may be able to trade or sell bind on equip items.

	In-Game Behavior
- "Tooltip Information" : When a player clicks on the name of a rare mob, the tooltip will indicate that the mob is rare, helping players identify and target these creatures.
- "Dungeons" : Some rare mobs can be found in dungeons, though they are not part of the main dungeon runs. They may appear as wandering creatures within the dungeon or in specific locations that require players to actively seek them out.
