			Rare Monster

	1. Introduction

	Rare Monsters (RMs) are a special class of monsters in World Game that differ significantly from common monsters in both behavior and rewards. They are designed
to present unique challenges to players, requiring strategy, timing, and sometimes group coordination to defeat. Rare Monsters are often tied to exploration, world 
events, and progression systems, serving as dynamic encounters that enrich gameplay beyond standard monster spawns.

	Key Features :

* Increased Difficulty : Rare Monsters typically have higher HP, stronger stats, and more advanced combat logic than common or elite monsters of the same rank.
* Unique Abilities : They often possess special skills, debuffs, or CCs that can disrupt unprepared players.
* Event/Location Tied : Rare Monsters may spawn under certain environmental conditions, during night/day cycles, or as part of events and quests.
* Reward Incentive : These monsters drop rare and unique loot, which may include exclusive crafting materials, mounts, pets, or cosmetic items. They may also 
trigger pity systems for guaranteed rare drops.
* Role in World Progression : Defeating Rare Monsters may unlock story elements, open secret areas, or influence faction or territory control mechanics.

	Player Interaction Considerations :

* Some Rare Monsters are soloable for high-level players, while others are intended for small parties or coordinated groups.
* Awareness of mechanics like "Rage Mode", "Panic Mode", and environment-specific effects is crucial for success.
* Rare Monsters can sometimes interact dynamically with nearby mobs, either reinforcing them or applying buffs/debuffs to create layered challenges.

	6. Environmental Interactions

	Rare Monsters are designed not only to be tougher than their common counterparts but also to feel like they *belong* in the world. Their behaviors and mechanics
are deeply tied to the environments they inhabit, making each encounter unique and region-specific.

---

	6.1 Terrain-Based Behavior

* Forests : Rare Monsters here may use cover and ambush tactics. For example, a rare wolf could stalk players silently before attacking, while a rare dryad might 
root intruders with vines. Fallen logs, undergrowth, and shadows can play into their combat style.
* Caves : Rare cave-dwellers often utilize darkness and confined spaces. They may cause rockfalls or echoing roars that disorient players. Fighting them requires 
light sources or anti-blindness abilities.
* Swamps : Rare swamp monsters might drag players into bogs, reduce movement speed with mud, or spread toxins into the air and water. Visibility is often poor, 
adding difficulty.
* Dungeons : Rare dungeon spawns take advantage of narrow corridors and scripted traps. They can use dungeon features like collapsing ceilings, lava flows, or spike
traps to pressure players.

temporarily.
* Illusions / Shadow Magic : Rare spectral or trickster monsters may use illusions to disorient playersâ€”duplicating themselves, shifting the terrain visually, or 
causing hallucinations that hide traps.
* Earth/Weather Manipulation : Some rare earthbound monsters may cause tremors, collapsing terrain or changing safe zones. Others may call storms that obscure 
vision and weaken ranged attacks.
