			Aggro Reset

	"Aggro reset" is a mechanic where a mob or boss clears the accumulated threat of all players involved in the combat, causing the mob or boss to lose track of who 
it was attacking. After an aggro reset, the mob will choose a new target, typically the player with the highest threat at the moment. However, until the tank 
generates sufficient threat again, the mob may shift between players, causing chaos during fights.

	Causes of Aggro Rese" :
Several factors can lead to an aggro reset:
- "Encounter mechanics" (scripted resets) : These are usually part of a boss encounter, occurring in specific stages of the fight, such as after a phase transition or
a major area-of-effect (AoE) ability.
- "Environmental conditions" :
	- Exceeding the NPC's maximum pursuit distance (sometimes called "chaining") or
	- Moving to a location the NPC cannot reach, particularly if the mob is melee-focused and the player moves to an unreachable area.
- "Encounter bugs" : Sometimes, a bug in the scripting of the encounter may cause unintended aggro resets, disrupting normal mob behavior.

	Considerations :
- When an aggro reset is scripted as part of a boss fight, it is essential for players to manage their damage output to avoid pulling aggro prematurely. 
"DPS players" should reduce their damage output until the tank has had time to rebuild enough threat to regain control over the mob.
- The new target selected by the mob after an aggro reset may not be based on threat levels. In some situations, the mob might target another random player, 
increasing the need for vigilance from all party members.
