			Leash

		Leash Mechanics : 

	"Leashing" refers to the behavior where a mob clears its aggro list, switches to "Evade mode", and runs back to its spawn point, effectively resetting the encounter.

	Leashing in Overland Areas 

1. "Player Escape Mechanism" :
   - Leashing is the primary way for players to escape combat in overland areas. Players can break aggro by running far enough in one direction, causing the mob to 
reset and cease the attack.
   - If a player attacks the mob while running, it will reset the "leash range", making it possible to pull the mob further from its spawn point by periodically 
attacking it (for example, walking backwards while meleeing).

2. "Preventing Griefing" :
   - Leashing also helps prevent griefing, such as "training" where players lure mobs to attack others. Since mobs in "Evade mode" will not aggro on anyone they run 
past while returning to their spawn point, this mechanic helps control unwanted mob behavior and keeps players safe from accidental confrontations.

	Leashing in Boss Encounters

1. "Bosses and Leashing" :
   - For "boss mobs", particularly in indoor encounters, leashing is triggered differently. Many bosses are designed to be fought in specific locations, and if pulled
out of this designated area, the boss will automatically leash.
   - The boss will clear its aggro list and return to its spawn point in "Evade mode", even if it was recently attacked.

2. "Exceptions" :
   - Some bosses do not leash at all or are fought in areas where leashing is impossible, making them a persistent threat until defeated.
