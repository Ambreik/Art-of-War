			Spawn Point Mechanics

	A "Spawn Point" refers to a specific location where a mob will respawn after being killed, once its respawn timer has elapsed. It acts as the mob's designated 
"home" or origin within the game world. 

		Key Features of Spawn Points

1. "Respawn After Death" :  
   When a mob is killed, it will respawn at its designated Spawn Point after a set respawn time. This ensures that mobs are constantly available for players to engage
with.

2. "Mob Movement Around Spawn Point" :  
   Some mobs may wander around the area surrounding their Spawn Point. This is typically the mob's designated roaming area or patrol zone, where it moves until it 
aggroes or engages with a player.

3. "Leashing Behavior" :  
   - "Leashing to Spawn Point" : If a mob loses its target, meaning there are no players on its aggro list (whether through death, fleeing, or other reasons), it 
will leash back to its Spawn Point.  
   - "Patrolling Mobs" : Mobs that are patrolling will return to their last known position or the spot they were patrolling before they engaged in combat with a 
player.
