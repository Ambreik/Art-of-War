		Threat List Mechanics

	A "Threat List", also known as a "Hate List", is a ranking system used by mobs to track and prioritize which players they are most aggressive towards. This list
is ordered from the player with the most threat (the highest position) to the one with the least.

- "Aggro Target" : The player at the top of the Threat List is typically the one the mob will attack. However, the system isn’t always perfect. While the player 
with the most threat generally has aggro, the behavior can be more dynamic and context-dependent.
- "In Group Combat" : In a group, each player’s actions will influence their position on the Threat List. Other players’ actions also move them up or down, so even 
if you do nothing, your relative position can change as other players perform actions.

		Factors That Move a Player Up the Threat List

	Certain actions can increase a player's threat and push them up the Threat List:

- "Damage Dealt" : Every point of damage dealt to the mob adds threat and moves the player up the list.
- "Aggro-Gaining Skills and Abilities" : Skills and abilities specifically designed to generate threat (like Taunts) will move the player higher on the list.
- "Healing Players on the Threat List" : Healing any player already on the Threat List, even if not directly attacking the mob, will increase the healer’s threat.

		Factors That Move a Player Down the Threat List

	Certain actions can lower a player's threat and push them down the Threat List:

- "Stealth (Assassin)" : The "Stealth" ability allows an assassin to reduce their threat significantly.
- "Invisible Cloth (Healer)" : A healer using "Invisible Cloth" can reduce their threat, making it less likely the mob will target them.
- "Vanish (Assassin)" : The "Vanish" ability causes the assassin to completely disappear from the Threat List.
- "Metamorphosis (Vampire)" : The "Metamorphosis" ability lowers threat by transforming the player into a different form.
- "Enchanted Armour (Sorcerer)" : The "Enchanted Armour" ability can make the sorcerer’s threat less noticeable to the mob.
- "Great Leap (Werewolf)" : The "Great Leap" ability allows a werewolf to escape the mob's attention, lowering their threat.
- Mobs’ Spells or Debuffs" : Certain mobs have abilities that can reduce a player’s threat, such as **Onyxia's Knock Away**, which can knock players away and lower their threat level.

		Things That Remove a Player from the Threat List Completely

- "Running Far Enough Away" : If the player runs far enough away from the mob (and is not in an instance), they can be completely removed from the Threat List.
- "Death" : If the player dies, they will be removed from the Threat List entirely.
