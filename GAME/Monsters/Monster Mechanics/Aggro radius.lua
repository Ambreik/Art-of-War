			Aggro Radius

	The "aggro radius" is the distance around a player at which a hostile mob will stop its idle behavior and engage in combat. This mechanic determines how far a 
player can get near a mob without provoking it into attacking. The aggro radius is primarily influenced by the level difference between the mob and the player.

	Level-Based Behavior:
- Higher-level characters have a smaller aggro radius in relation to the mobs they encounter. They can often run through areas filled with mobs without provoking 
them, though there is typically a minimum radius that will always trigger the mob's attention, no matter how much higher the player's level is.
- Lower-level characters may trigger aggro from mobs from much farther away than expected. When a low-level player wanders into an area filled with higher-level 
mobs, they are more likely to be attacked at long range, even if they don't appear to be in immediate danger. 

	This discrepancy becomes important in situations where a high-level player is helping a lower-level one:
- The higher-level player may be safe in areas that are not safe for the lower-level player. They should be aware of mobs that ignore them but might attack the 
lower-level player.
- The lower-level player should not assume safety just because the higher-level player can pass through an area without triggering aggro. The mob's attention may 
be drawn to the lower-level character instead.

		Co-Aggro:
	"Co-aggro" occurs when a mob that is already in combat (e.g., Commando) moves into the aggro radius of another mob (e.g., Security). While Security was not 
originally hostile, it will now join the fight due to the proximity to the already-engaged Commando. At first, Security has no threat on the player (e.g., Paula), 
but it will begin attacking unless someone else generates threat to control it.

	This situation is more likely when:
- The player uses movement-based abilities such as "Fear" to reposition mobs (the mob may wander out of aggro range or into new mobs' aggro zones).
- Mobs are tightly packed in certain locations, like dungeons, and a mob is inadvertently moved into another mob's aggro radius.
- The player makes missteps, such as jumping or moving across ledges, causing the mobs to take unpredictable paths toward them.

	Co-aggro is especially probable when mobs are of the same faction or creature type. Friendly NPCs (marked green) will never co-aggro, but neutral or unfriendly 
NPCs (yellow or orange) can.

		Non-Radius-Based Aggro:
	There are certain aggro mechanics not related to proximity:
- "Group Aggro" : Some mobs, when engaged, will cause all other members of their group to aggro the player, even if they were outside their individual aggro radii. 
This is common when the player attacks any member of a mob group (e.g., pulling an elite mob).
	- Sometimes, group aggro is "asymmetric" : it might be impossible to pull one mob without aggroing the whole group, but the player might be able to pull one 
mob away from the group using ranged attacks without triggering aggro from the others.
- "Shouting Aggro" : Certain monsters may have a "shout" ability that generates aggro in a large area, pulling other monsters toward the player even if they are 
outside their aggro radius. This can lead to the premature engagement of bosses or mobs in dungeons and should be handled carefully with crowd control and 
interrupts.
