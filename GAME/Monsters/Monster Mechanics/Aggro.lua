			Aggro

		Aggro Mechanics

	"Aggro" is a term used in the World Game to denote the aggressive interest of a monster or NPC towards a player. When a mob has aggro on a player, it means that
the mob is actively targeting and attacking them. "Threat" is the numerical value that represents how much a mob "hates" a player, and the player with the highest 
threat will be targeted by the mob.

	General Aggro Information

1. "Aggro and Threat" :
   - Aggro is tied to the threat a player generates. If a mob is under attack by multiple players, it will target the player with the highest threat 
(usually the tank).
   - While aggro is the mob’s condition of attacking a character, "threat" is the numeric value that each attacker has on the mob’s threat list. 
   - Aggro control is essential in group play to ensure that the mob targets the tank, preventing weaker characters from being attacked.

2. "Types of Mobs" :
   - "Neutral Mobs" : Will not attack until provoked. They are surrounded by a yellow circle when targeted.
   - "Hostile Mobs" : Will attack immediately when a player enters their "aggro radius" (red circle). This radius is affected by both the mob's and the character's 
level.
   
3. "Role of the Tank" :
   - The "tank" is responsible for holding aggro and ensuring that the mob focuses on them. This prevents damage-dealing classes (DPS) or healers from being 
attacked.
   - In solo play, pets (e.g., for vampires and archers) often serve as the tank.

	Aggro Control in Parties

1. "Aggro Management" :
   - Aggro control is not solely the tank’s responsibility. Every member in a party should be mindful of their actions to prevent drawing aggro away from the tank.
   - "Taunting" : Tanks can use "taunt" abilities to force the mob to target them again if aggro is lost. However, in well-coordinated groups, tanks may rarely need
to taunt if all members manage aggro properly.
   
2. "Class-Specific Aggro Control" :
   - Some classes can control the threat they generate:
     - "Damage Dealers" : Should wait for the tank to build aggro before attacking and avoid using high-damage spells too early in the fight.
     - "Healers" : Should avoid attacking to prevent generating unnecessary threat, especially if their healing spells are powerful.
     - "DPS Classes" : Should stop attacking if they notice their threat is too high and the mob may switch to them.

	Aggro Generation and Pulling

1. "When a Mob Aggros" :
   A mob will attack a character under the following conditions:
   - The player attacks the mob (using abilities or normal attacks).
   - The player enters the mob’s aggro radius.

2. "Special Considerations" :
   - "Healers" : Should be mindful of their healing timings to avoid drawing aggro.
   - "DPS" : Should allow the tank to build threat before dealing heavy damage.
   - "Pets" : Pets, especially for "Archers" and "Vampires", should be recalled in indoor fights to avoid aggroing other mobs unintentionally.

	Managing Aggro During Combat

1. "Aggro and Damage" :
   - The more damage a player deals (or healing they provide), the more threat they generate.
   - "High-damage abilities" generate more threat than lower-damage or damage-over-time spells.
   - Some abilities may either increase or decrease the amount of threat generated (these are often noted in the ability tooltips).
   
2. "Class-Specific Threat Control" :
   - "Stealth" (Assassin), "Invisible Cloth" (Shaman), "Fear" (Sorcerer), and "Faint" (Archer) can be used to prevent drawing aggro or reduce it once generated.
   - "DPS Classes" : If threat levels get too high, DPS players should stop attacking until their threat level is reduced.

	Who a Mob Targets

1. "Mob Aggro List" :
   - Most mobs target the player at the top of their "hate list" or "aggro list", but some abilities may cause the mob to ignore this order:
   
   - "Knockback Abilities" : Some mobs have knockback abilities that may cause them to temporarily forget the player they were attacking and switch to another 
target.
   - "Random Secondary Targeting" : Some high-end bosses randomly target a party member and attack them, even if they aren’t at the top of the hate list. Typically,
this target is attacked for a short duration before the mob returns to the main target.
   - "Weak Class Targeting" : Some bosses may target party members with low HP or certain classes (e.g., Healers, Ninjas, Vampires) due to their vulnerability in 
battle.

	Securing Aggro

1. "Tank’s Role in Securing Aggro" :
   - "Tanks" secure aggro by generating threat quickly and consistently. They may use threat-generating abilities to establish and maintain aggro on a mob.
   
2. "Spamming Threat-Generating Abilities" :
   - Tanks can use "taunts", abilities that generate threat, and certain class-specific abilities (e.g., "Enchanted Armour" for Sorcerers) to keep the mob focused 
on them.

	Drawing Aggro

1. "Conditions That Draw Aggro" :
	- "Taunting" : A taunt ability will force the mob to attack the player.
	- "Exceeding Threat Cap" :
		- If a player exceeds the threat level of the mob's current target by 10% (while in melee range) or 30% (while out of melee range), the mob will switch 
		targets.
	- "Leaving the Leash Range" : If the current target leaves the aggro range or instance, the mob may switch targets.
	- "Debuffs" : Some debuffs, such as "Polymorph" or "Fear", may cause the mob to treat the player as an invalid target, often resetting the threat when these 
debuffs wear off.

	Threat Reduction (Aggro Dumping)

1. "Aggro Reduction" :
	- Some classes have abilities that allow them to reduce the threat they generate or dump their current threat. These abilities are referred to as 
"aggro dumping" or "threat reduction".

2. "Aggro-Reducing Abilities" :
	- "Sorcerer" : [Fear]
	- "Ninja Assassin" : [Stealth], [Vanish]
	- "Shaman Healer" : [Invisible Cloth]
	- "Werewolf" : [Great Leap]
	- "Vampire" : [Metamorphosis]

3. "Classes Without Threat-Lowering Abilities" :
	- "Warriors" do not have any inherent threat-lowering abilities.
