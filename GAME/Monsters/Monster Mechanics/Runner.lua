			Runner

		Runner Mechanics

	A "Runner" refers to a mob that attempts to escape from a battle, typically when its health points are low or it becomes feared. This behavior is most common in
humanoid mobs. When a mob attempts to run, players receive the following system message:

> "System Message" : "<mob> attempts to run away in fear!"

	Key Characteristics of Runners

1. "Escape Behavior" :
   - Runners flee from combat, either because they are low on health or are under the effect of fear.
   - This often happens when the mob perceives that it is losing the battle and seeks to escape in order to avoid being killed.

2. "Consequences of Running" :
   - If a mob runs too close to other mobs, it can alert them to the presence of the player or group, causing additional mobs to engage in combat.
   - This can lead to a "wipe" (total party defeat), particularly if the group is already low on health or resources.

3. "Combat Strategies Against Runners" :
   - Players typically try to kill low-health mobs quickly to prevent them from running.
   - Alternatively, players may use crowd control abilities such as "snare", "stun", or "root" to keep runners in place long enough to defeat them.
   
4. "Random Pathing" :
   - The path that a runner takes is relatively random. In some cases, especially in cleared or empty areas, the runner may not alert any additional mobs, minimizing 
the risk of further conflict.
   - Runners may circle for a while before eventually returning to their previous target and resuming the attack.

5. "Combat Status" :
   - Players remain "in combat" with a mob until it is killed or disengages. This means that even if the mob runs, the player must still deal with it before they can 
exit combat mode.

6. "When to Let Runners Escape" :
   - In certain critical encounters where other threats take precedence, it may be more beneficial to let a mob run rather than chase and kill it immediately. In 
these cases, the fleeing mob can serve as a "free fear effect", providing a temporary break from combat.
