			Bag

		Introduction to Bags
	Bags are essential inventory management tools in the game, allowing players to increase their carrying capacity and hold more items. As inventory 
space is limited, managing and upgrading bags is a crucial aspect of gameplay that supports character progression. 

- "Initial Inventory" : Players begin with 45 inventory slots.
- "Unlocking More Inventory" : 
  - At level 40, a quest from the "Storekeeper NPC" unlocks an additional inventory page with 45 slots.
  - Up to 2 additional pages can be unlocked using specific bags from the NPC.
  - A special store inventory (40 slots) is available, which can be expanded with special bags up to 120 slots.
  - Unlimited inventory slots are achievable by purchasing special bags using "Diamonds" for 30 days or obtaining a "Legendary" bag.
  
- "Special Bags" : Certain bags, such as the "Herb Bag" or "Harry's Bag," serve unique purposes like temporary item borrowing, and they can hold items
that are returned after a certain time limit (e.g., 7 days in the "BANK").
