			Global Cooldown (GCD)

	The "Global Cooldown (GCD)" is a system that governs the cooldown of abilities and spells within a game. It is a universal cooldown that is triggered whenever a
player uses a spell or ability, and it applies to all of the character's abilities or class spells, with a few exceptions.

	Key Concepts of Global Cooldown :
1. Triggering the GCD :  
   - The GCD begins each time a spell or ability is activated. This cooldown affects all of your abilities, including spells, attacks, or other abilities within your class's toolkit.  
   - While the GCD is in effect, you must wait for it to finish before being able to use any other abilities that are affected by it.

2. Base Global Cooldown :
   - The "base GCD" is usually "1.5 seconds" for most classes, although some classes or abilities might have a reduced GCD of "1 second".  
   - For some specific abilities, the GCD can be as short as "0.5 seconds", enabling faster ability use.  
   - "Haste" (a stat) does not influence the GCD for any class, meaning that no matter how much haste you have, the GCD remains fixed unless a specific effect 
alters it.

3. Interrupted Spells :  
   - If a spell with a casting time is interrupted (e.g., by a knockdown or stun) before it completes, the global cooldown is canceled. This allows you to 
immediately cast another spell or ability without waiting for the remainder of the global cooldown.

4. Instant Cast Spells :  
   - Spells with "instant casts" or abilities that don't require casting time do not trigger the global cooldown. These are referred to as "off the global cooldown" or "not affected by the GCD".  
   - These abilities can be used while the GCD is in effect for other abilities, enabling you to chain abilities together more fluidly.

5. Off the Global Cooldown Abilities :  
   - Some abilities are designed to be "instant" and not trigger the GCD, which allows them to be used immediately after other abilities or even simultaneously with
them. These abilities often serve to enhance the character or provide immediate effects like buffs, healing, or temporary boosts.
   
6. Example of GCD Usage :
   - If you use a spell with a 1.5-second cooldown, after using it, you must wait for the GCD to finish before casting another ability that is affected by the GCD. 
   - If an ability has a 0.5-second GCD, it would allow you to cast other abilities in a shorter window, giving you more flexibility during combat.

	Items with Global Cooldown :
Certain items in the game also share the GCD, meaning that after using an item with a cooldown, you must wait for the GCD to finish before using another item or 
spell affected by the GCD.

- Examples of Items with GCD :
	- "Healing Potions"
	- "Mana Potions"
	- "Energy Potions"
	- "Rage Potions"
	- "Attack Speed Potions"
	- "Movement Speed Potions"
	- "Other consumable items" like food or drinks

		Shared Cooldown :
	Some consumable items, such as "alcoholic beverages", have a "shared cooldown" between different items of the same type. This means if you use one healing 
potion, you may not be able to use another healing potion or similar item until the cooldown for the shared item is complete.
