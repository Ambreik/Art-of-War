		Recharge Time
		
	Definition : Recharge time is the minimum period that must pass before a character can attempt to use a skill again after activation. If a skill is interrupted, 
disrupted (e.g., through knockdowns), or its activation fails, the recharge time begins once the skill is completed or canceled.

	Visual Indicator : The skill icon becomes darkened when the skill is in recharge and gradually brightens over time, indicating the cooldown progress, much like 
the movement of a clock's hands from noon to midnight.

	Game Mechanics of Recharge Time : 
	
1. Starting the Recharge :  
   - A skill enters its recharge phase immediately after activation is completed or if the skill activation is disrupted (e.g., interrupted by a knockdown). 
   
2. Effect of Energy :
   - If a skill requires "Energy" to activate, it cannot gain energy while in the recharge state. Players need to manage their energy resource carefully as it won't 
regenerate for skills under recharge.

3. Modifications to Recharge Time :
   - The recharge time of a skill can be modified by:
     - CDR (Cooldown Reduction) : Certain abilities, items, or environmental effects can reduce the recharge time of skills.
     - Debuffs/Effects : Some negative effects or debuffs can increase the recharge time of skills, forcing players to wait longer between uses.

4. Failure or Interruption : 
   - Skills that fail (due to being blocked or not meeting conditions) will be available immediately again, bypassing the recharge time entirely.
   - Skills that are interrupted (e.g., by knockdowns or stuns) will still have their recharge time triggered after the disruption ends.

	Strategic Use of Recharge Time : 
	
- Timing : Players need to carefully time their abilities, as the recharge time restricts their options for subsequent actions. A failed or interrupted skill still 
enters recharge, meaning players should avoid unnecessary risks if they expect failure or interruption.
  
- Synergies : Skills that reduce recharge time or accelerate energy gain can synergize well with others, allowing players to chain abilities or maintain combat 
momentum.

- Buffs/Debuffs Impacting Recharge :
   - "Buffs" that reduce recharge time can provide an advantage in high-stakes battles, enabling quicker skill usage.
   - "Debuffs" or negative status effects that increase recharge time can severely hinder a player's ability to act quickly in combat, making timing and position 
even more critical.
