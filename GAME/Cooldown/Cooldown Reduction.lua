			Cooldown Reduction

	Cooldown Reduction (CDR) is a mechanic that decreases the time it takes for a character's abilities, skills, and items to recharge after use. This allows 
players to use their abilities more frequently, giving them a strategic advantage in combat or gameplay. The concept applies universally, meaning it is not 
exclusive to magic-based or specific character classes.

		Key Aspects of Cooldown Reduction :

1. Base Cooldown/Speed :
   - Every character starts with a "Spell/Charm Speed" of 100%, which determines the base recharge time for all abilities.
   - "Cooldown Reduction" (CDR) reduces this time, making abilities ready to be used more quickly.

2. Sources of Cooldown Reduction :
   - Necklaces (Standard Bonus)
   - Weapons
   - Armor
   - Stone of Haste (can be placed on weapons for additional CDR)
   
3. External Buffs :
   - "Haste Buffs" from abilities (e.g., a "healing shaman"'s buff) can further increase CDR.
   - Certain "runes", like the "Liquor of Haste", increase CDR by a set percentage (e.g., 20%) for a limited duration (e.g., 30 minutes).

4. Impact of Cooldown Reduction :
	- Reduces Recharge Time : CDR decreases the time it takes for abilities and items to be ready for use again, allowing for quicker response in combat.
	- Strategic Advantage : With faster cooldowns, players can use their powerful abilities more often, enabling more damage, healing, or utility in a shorter 
timeframe.

5. Interaction with Other Cooldown Types :
   - Shared Cooldowns : Some abilities, items, or spells share cooldowns. This means that when one ability with a shared cooldown is used, it also applies a 
cooldown to other abilities in the same category, preventing their use until the cooldown expires.
   - Global Cooldown : The global cooldown, or GCD, impacts all abilities and starts when any ability is used. Cooldown Reduction can also affect the length of the 
GCD, allowing abilities to be used more frequently in some cases.

6. Special Abilities :
	- Tradeskill Cooldowns :
		- Enchanting : A bonus can be changed every 60 seconds, even if it is not successfully applied.
		- Mining and Herbalism : Specific cooldowns apply depending on the resource nodes or gathering.
		- Biologist Missions : The cooldown for the first missions is 24 hours, while "Legendary Missions" can have up to "72 hours per mission".

		Summary :
	Cooldown Reduction allows characters to use abilities more often by reducing the time it takes for those abilities to recharge. It can come from various sources
such as equipment, buffs, and specific items or runes. By reducing the recharge time, players can respond more quickly and execute more actions during combat, 
creating a faster-paced and strategic gameplay experience.
