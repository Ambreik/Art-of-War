			Shared Cooldown
			
	Definition : A "shared cooldown" is when multiple spells, items, or abilities have their cooldowns linked together, preventing the use of certain abilities 
while one of them is cooling down.

	Important Points :
	
	- When a "shared cooldown" is triggered by one ability, other abilities that share this cooldown cannot be used until the cooldown period ends.
	- This system is especially significant for "potions", where multiple potions may share the same cooldown. If you use one potion, you will not be able to use 
others of the same type until the cooldown expires.
	- The shared cooldown duration doesn't always match the cooldown time of individual abilities, meaning a powerful ability with a long cooldown may share a 
short cooldown with others, limiting the use of similar abilities in a short time frame.

	Strategic Considerations :
	- Players need to plan carefully when using abilities or items with shared cooldowns to avoid accidentally locking themselves out of multiple powerful effects.
	- This mechanic is often used to prevent players from stacking buffs or powerful abilities that could imbalance gameplay, ensuring that using one strong ability
doesnâ€™t automatically give access to others that could be excessively powerful.

	Example :
- A "Healing Potion" and a "Mana Potion" might share a cooldown, so if you use one, you won't be able to use the other until the cooldown period ends.
- Certain "buff abilities" may have a shared cooldown, preventing players from using multiple stacked buffs at once, maintaining game balance.

	Shared Cooldown for Runes 
	
	Definition : A "shared cooldown" for runes means that runes with similar effects cannot be used simultaneously. If one rune is active or in cooldown, the others
that provide similar bonuses cannot be activated until the cooldown period of the first rune expires.
	Purpose : This system ensures balance by preventing players from stacking multiple powerful effects from runes that provide similar types of bonuses at the same
time.

		Categories of Runes Affected by Shared Cooldown
	
	These categories of runes typically have "shared cooldowns" due to providing similar effects:

	1. Offensive Power Boost Runes
- Runes that increase physical or elemental damage (melee, ranged, or magical) would be grouped together under a shared cooldown.  
   *For example, activating one rune that boosts physical damage would prevent another rune that boosts elemental damage (like fire, ice, or lightning) from being 
used until the cooldown ends.*

	2. Defensive Power Boost Runes
- Runes that increase resistance to damage or provide temporary armor boosts would share cooldowns.  
   *For example, activating a rune that boosts overall damage reduction would prevent another rune that boosts resistance to a specific damage type 
(e.g., fire or ice resistance) from being used during the cooldown period.*

	3. Movement Speed Boost Runes
- Runes that increase movement speed or evasion for a short period of time would share a cooldown.  
   *Activating one rune that boosts speed would lock out other speed-boosting runes until the first one has fully cooled down.*

	4. Critical Hit Chance Runes
- Runes that increase the chance of landing critical hits, whether for physical or magical attacks, would be affected by shared cooldowns.  
   *For instance, activating a rune that increases critical chance for one type of attack (e.g., melee or ranged) would prevent the use of other critical chance 
boosting runes until the cooldown period is over.*

	5. Healing or Regeneration Runes
- Runes that heal the player or provide regeneration over time would share cooldowns.  
   *For example, using a rune that heals health over time would prevent the activation of another rune that provides a similar healing effect until the cooldown 
period has elapsed.*

	Cooldown Duration for Shared Runes
- The "cooldown durations" for runes with shared effects can vary based on their potency:
	- "Minor Runes" : Shared cooldowns ranging from 30 seconds to 1 minute.
	- "Major Runes" : Shared cooldowns lasting 3 to 5 minutes.
	- "Ultimate Runes" : Shared cooldowns of 10 to 15 minutes or longer.

	Strategic Considerations
- "Rune Usage" : Players must carefully manage their rune activations to avoid overlapping similar effects, as using one will lock out others with matching bonuses.
- "Timing" : Players need to plan when to activate their runes based on the shared cooldowns to optimize their combat effectiveness.
- "Balance" : The shared cooldown system helps ensure that no single type of effect becomes overly dominant in gameplay, maintaining balance during combat and other
in-game activities.
