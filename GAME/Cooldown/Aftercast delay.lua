			Aftercast Delay
			
	Definition : The period of time after activating certain skills when the player cannot move or use other skills. Typically, this lasts ¾ of a second.
	Guidelines :
    - Skills with Aftercast Delay : 
        - Chants, rituals (e.g., Shaman, Warlocks)
        - All spells (unless otherwise noted)
        - Any skill that causes a shift (e.g., shapeshifting or teleportation)
        - Camouflage skills
        - Ranged skills
        - Attack skills with a specified activation time
        - Summoning mounts, pets, or companions
        - Summoning specific guardians or barons (2-second delay)
    - Skills without Aftercast Delay :
        - Skills without activation time
        - Shadow steps that are not targeting a foe

	This system will help ensure that combat feels strategic, as players must plan around these delays and can’t spam abilities without considering timing. When 
creating monster abilities, NPC actions, or other systems, we can incorporate aftercast delays to make gameplay feel dynamic and challenging.
