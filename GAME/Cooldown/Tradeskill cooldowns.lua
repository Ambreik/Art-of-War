			Tradeskill Cooldowns
			
	Definition : Certain crafting professions have cooldowns for specific recipes or actions, preventing players from repeatedly crafting the same item within a set 
period.

	General Note : 
	- Many "1 day" cooldowns are reset daily, typically at 1am server time, rather than lasting 24 hours exactly.
- Specific Professions :
	- Alchemy : Several transmutes (recipes for converting one item into another) have cooldowns. Many older transmutes share a "20-hour cooldown".
	- Enchanting : (Details not provided, but likely related to cooldowns for enchanting powerful items or rare effects).
	- Inscription : (Similar to Enchanting, probably involves cooldowns for crafting glyphs or scrolls).
	- Mining : 20-hour cooldown for refining certain high-quality materials or ores.
	- Tailoring : Separate **1-2 day cooldowns** for each recipe at the highest rank, limiting the ability to craft the most powerful or rare items.

	This system creates balance in resource management and crafting, ensuring that players cannot flood the market with high-demand items, and encouraging more 
planning and strategy in tradeskill progression.
