			Experience Mechanics in World Game

		Overview of Experience (XP)  
	Experience (XP) is essential for character progression. Gaining XP allows players to level up, unlock new abilities, improve stats, equip better armor and 
weapons, and more. Without XP, characters cannot advance in the game. 

	1. XP Acquisition
	XP is earned primarily through killing monsters and completing quests. The amount of XP needed to level up varies between levels, and the progress is tracked 
through experience balls located in the bottom left corner of the player's screen. 

- "Experience Balls" : As players accumulate XP, they fill the experience balls. Upon filling the first three balls, players earn one stat point. When the fourth ball is filled, players level up, gaining one additional skill point and fully restoring health and mana. 

- "XP Display" : The XP bar and the amount required to reach the next level can be checked in the Status window (accessed by pressing "C" or the status button).

	2. Relative Experience  
	The amount of XP gained is influenced by the level difference between the player and the enemy.

- Level Difference : 
  - If the player’s level is lower than the enemy’s, they gain a small bonus (up to +30% XP depending on the level difference).
  - If the enemy is lower-level, the player will receive progressively less XP, with a minimum of 1% XP when the enemy is more than 14 levels below.
  
- XP Distribution by Enemy Level :
  - Level Difference >=15 : +130% XP
  - Level Difference +14 : +128% XP
  - Level Difference +13 : +126% XP
  - (and so on until)
  - Level Difference -14 or more : 1% XP

	3. XP for Exploration and Other Activities
- Players can earn XP for exploring unknown islands, gathering rare herbs or minerals, archaeology, and opening certain types of chests.
- Quests generally provide fixed XP rewards, with level-capped characters receiving gold instead of XP.

	4. Player Participation in Combat
	XP is awarded to players who actively participate in combat:
- Combat Participation : Players must actively engage with mobs to earn XP. If most of the damage is dealt by NPCs or permanent pets, the player will not receive any XP.
- No AFK Grinding : Players cannot gain XP by luring mobs to NPCs or guards, nor can pet classes use pets to gain XP passively.

	5. Out-Leveling Zones
	Once a player reaches the maximum level for an expansion, killing creatures in that expansion's zones provides only 10% of the normal XP. Quests continue to 
reward full XP or gold for level-capped players.

	6. Factors Affecting XP Gain
	Several factors can affect how much XP is earned, and many of these bonuses stack.

	Solo Bonuses :
- "Potion of Wisdom" : Grants +20% XP for 1 hour.
- "Mulled Wine" : Grants +10% XP for 30 minutes.
- "Ring of Wisdom" : Grants +10% XP from Mystic Stones or Boxes for 30 minutes.
- "Zen Pasta" : Grants +10% XP for completing the next 5 quests.
- "Signet of Brave" : Grants +20% XP for 3 hours in combat against monsters.

	Group Bonuses :
- "Book of the Leader" : When activated by the group leader, all group members receive 30% additional XP for 2 hours.

	Mount Bonuses :
- "Powerful Mounts" : Some mounts have a passive chance to grant an XP bonus (3% for Wild Mounts, 5% for Valiant Mounts).

	Equipment Bonuses :
- "Shoes" : 1-5% chance of granting an XP bonus.
- "Necklaces" : 1-5% chance of granting an XP bonus.

	Item-Shop Bonuses :
- "Ring of Wisdom" (from Item-Shop): Grants +50% XP for 7 days.

	7. Experience Points in a Group
	When players are in a group, all members receive XP for kills, regardless of who dealt the final blow. The XP earned is distributed based on the group’s 
settings.

- XP Distribution Methods :
  1. Level Distribution : The XP is divided based on the relative levels of group members. Higher-level members receive a larger share. For example, if a level 50 and level 25 player are in the group, the level 50 player would get ⅔ of the XP and the level 25 player would get ⅓.
  2. Even Distribution : XP is split evenly among all members, regardless of level.

	Group Member Bonuses :
  - Group members receive additional XP based on the number of group members:
		- 1 member: 12% bonus XP
		- 2 members: 24% bonus XP
		- (and so on, with the highest possible bonus being 100% XP for a full group).

	XP Gain Radius : All group members within a certain radius of the group leader benefit from these bonuses.

	8. Disabling XP Gain
	Certain items in the game can disable XP gains temporarily:

- "Cape of Allegard" : Prevents any XP gain while worn. However, pets continue to gain XP until they reach the character’s level.
- AFK Grinding Limitations : While using "Cape of Allegard", the player cannot benefit from any other XP-boosting items or mounts.

	9. XP Item Interactions  
Some items cannot be used together to stack bonuses:
- "Potion of Wisdom" and "Ring of Wisdom" cannot be used at the same time.
- "Potion of Wisdom" and "Signet of Brave" cannot be used at the same time.
- "Book of the Leader" is exclusive to the group leader and cannot be used by other members.
