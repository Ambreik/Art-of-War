		Special Bonuses found on items : 
*Life on Hit - (a.k.a. Life per Hit) is an item attribute introduced in "underworld Platform", which works much like Life Steal in that upon inflicting damage upon 
	monsters. Unlike Life Steal, Life per Hit heals a fixed amount of Life for every damaging attack that hits an enemy target, regardless of the Proc Coefficient 
	and the amount of enemies hit. Note that unlike most 'on hit' effects, Life per Hit requires that you actually hit an enemy, not an object, and deal any damage 
	with that attack. This normally does not trigger off attacks from pets and minions, attacks that deal no damage and skills that do not interrupt normal casting,
	attacking and channeling. end end

shields when are dropped by monsters with a low change making them very valuable. Is a rare bonus.

character from its original position, with a chance to trigger of 5-50%.
