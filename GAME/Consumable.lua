- Double-Click to Use : Most consumables require a double-click to activate. Some may have cooldowns or restrictions on how often they can be used.
- Buff Restrictions : Buffs granted by consumables generally do not stack with other consumables providing the same type of effect (e.g., elixirs and flasks of the same stat do not stack).
- Non-PvP Consumables : Some consumables are restricted in PvP zones, and may not function in these areas.
- Reusable Consumables : Certain consumables are not single-use and can be consumed multiple times until they are exhausted.
- Stacking Consumables : Consumables like food and drink often stack, but powerful elixirs and potions usually do not.
