			Leveling System in World Game

	Overview of Leveling

	In "World Game", leveling refers to the process of gaining experience points (XP) to increase a characterâ€™s level. Leveling is integral to the gameplay 
experience and unlocks new abilities, spells, and access to more challenging content. The game is divided into two primary stages: leveling and the end-game.

		Evolution of Leveling

	1. Early Stages (Original Release)

- Players primarily leveled through quests, fighting non-player enemies, and instances (dungeons and special encounters). Each zone was designed for specific level 
ranges, ensuring a smooth progression of difficulty and challenges for the player.
- Player vs. Player (PvP) activity did not provide experience in the original version. The focus was solely on PvE activities.

	2. Outland Territories and the Level Cap Expansion

- With the introduction of "Outland Territories", the level cap was increased to 120 and brought several changes to the leveling mechanics:
	- Players could now earn XP from battlegrounds (PvP), alongside traditional PvE activities.
	- "Rare", "Epic", and "Legendary items" were introduced, and these items scale with the player's level. 
- The "Looking for Group" (LFG) tool became an important feature, allowing players to form groups for "dungeons" and "raids", leading many players to focus on 
dungeon leveling.

		Resting Bonus

	The "Resting Bonus" is a key mechanic for boosting XP gains in "World Game" and is tied to "Taverns" :
- "Taverns" are special buildings found in secluded locations across the world. They serve as "safe zones" where players can rest to gain a "Resting Bonus". This 
bonus increases the amount of XP earned from combat and questing while the player is "resting" in the Tavern.
    - Taverns are the only buildings where the "Resting Bonus" mechanic works, and they are located in remote, less-traveled locations in some areas of the game.
- "Inns", while also serving as safe zones, do not provide the "Resting Bonus". They are typically located within cities and act as safe places to heal,store items,
and access other services, but do not offer the experience boost provided by Taverns.

		Power Leveling

	"Power leveling" refers to the strategy of leveling a character as quickly as possible, using optimized methods to gain experience. Some common strategies 
include:
- "Dungeon runs" : Focusing on group dungeons and raids for large XP rewards.
- "Maximizing quests" : Completing high-reward quests in specific regions for significant XP gains.
- "Resting in Taverns" : Utilizing the "Resting Bonus" mechanic in Taverns to increase XP efficiency.
- "Use of items" : Equipping "Rare", "Epic", and "Legendary items" that provide bonuses to experience earned.

	Power leveling techniques can significantly reduce the time it takes to reach the level cap.
