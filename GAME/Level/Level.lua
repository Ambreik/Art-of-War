			Level

		Level has three meanings in World Game:

1. "Character Level" : All player characters, mobs, and NPCs in World Game have a level, reflecting their overall effectiveness, power, and ability. Player 
characters can increase their level through gaining experience, granting them access to new abilities, talents, and more powerful gear. Higher-level characters have
better base stats and are generally more formidable opponents.
2. "Skill Level" : Degrees of advancement in skills (professions) are sometimes referred to as levels. Skill level is required to perform profession- or skill-
related tasks such as crafting items or gathering resources. Skill level can be increased through performing relevant activities. See Profession.
3. "Item Level" : A scale for measuring the overall power and stat value of a given item. See Item level.

		Character Level

	The level of a player character, mob, or NPC determines that character's base stats. Factors such as their chance of being struck by other characters, along 
with their power and health, increase as they gain levels. Fighting a character of much higher level will present a significant challenge, while fighting a 
character of much lower level will generally prove much easier.

	However, level only determines each character base stats. Mob and NPC abilities and strengths vary according to type and rarity. While the power of player 
characters can be roughly gauged by their level, gear, abilities, and player skill can make a very large difference to a character overall capabilities. Therefore, 
level should not be considered the sole indicator of a player character's strength. Nonetheless, increasing level provides a considerable advantage for any 
character.

		Player Level

	Level for player characters holds additional significance:

- Abilities are unlocked as the player increases in level.
- New areas become viable for questing and exploration.
- New talents are granted at certain levels.
- New dungeons and battlegrounds become accessible.

	Most quests and items have a minimum character level, which the player must meet before they can accept the quest or equip the item. Quests of similar level are
generally of similar difficulty to complete, and items of similar level and rarity should have comparable stats.

		Leveling

	All player characters start at "level 1". Players can increase their character level by gaining "experience points" (XP). This process, known as "leveling", 
will gradually increase the character's stats, grant them access to new abilities, allow them to take on more challenging quests, equip more powerful gear, and 
tackle more difficult content.
	Player leveling is limited by the current "level cap", which is set at "level 120". Players below the level cap aim to increase their level primarily through 
questing, defeating enemies, and participating in other activities. Once a character reaches the level cap, they can access the "end-game" content, where the focus 
shifts from leveling to tackling high-level challenges and acquiring epic rewards.

		Experience Points (XP)

	Players earn experience points through various activities such as:
- "Questing" : Completing quests gives players significant amounts of XP.
- "Defeating Enemies" : Mobs, NPCs, and bosses provide XP based on their level and difficulty.
- "Resting in Taverns" : Players receive an XP boost when spending time in Taverns, which serve as designated safe zones. This "Resting Bonus" increases the rate at
which XP is gained for a set period, depending on the time spent in the tavern.

		Hit and Crit Chance

	When fighting mobs of higher or lower level than the player, there are variations in hit and crit chance :
- Orange and above mobs : These mobs greatly reduce your hit and crit chances, and they have an increased chance to hit or crit you. They can also deal crushing blows. You can offset this by acquiring items and skills that improve your defense.
- Green and Gray level mobs : These mobs generally have a lower defense skill than your weapon skill, leading to higher hit and crit chances against them.
- Yellow mobs : These mobs present a balanced challenge with accurate hit and crit chances.

		Notes and Trivia

- Characters under level 20 are typically considered newbies, and most players only begin to master their class starting around level 20.
- "Elite mobs" can vary widely in difficulty and may be much tougher than their level would indicate. Likewise, some non-elite mobs can be much easier than their 
level suggests.
- "Levels" serve as a general guideline. Some classes of creatures may perform better against others regardless of their level. For example, a rogue-like mob might be easier to kill than a priest-like mob for physical-based characters.
- "NPCs" such as trainers and quest-givers rarely reference a player character's level, though early quests may introduce players to new skill ranks.

		Level Cap

	The "maximum level" for player characters is "level 120". Although the game's code technically supports up to level 175, this level is only accessible to GM 
(Game Master) commands and is not available through regular gameplay.
