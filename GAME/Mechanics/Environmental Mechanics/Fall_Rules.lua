			Fall_Rules 

	Rules :  
- Non-Survivable Falls : If a player falls from a height beyond the game’s "safe fall" range (e.g., 100 meters or higher), the fall will result in instant death or near-death, unless specific environmental or magical protections are in place.
- Health Thresholds : If a player’s health is already low, fall damage may be significantly increased, leading to a higher chance of death.
- Combat Staggering : Players engaged in combat may experience a stagger effect upon falling, where they briefly lose control or take time to recover 
from the fall. This effect can leave the player vulnerable to additional attacks if they fall during a fight.
- No Fall Damage in Water or Soft Surfaces : Falls into water, deep snow, or other soft surfaces will prevent or drastically reduce damage from the 
fall, though there may still be movement speed penalties due to the terrain.
