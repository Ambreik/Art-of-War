			Boat Durability

		General Overview
	This file covers the durability mechanics for different types of boats in the game. The durability of a boat is a critical gameplay feature, as it
determines how long a boat can stay afloat and the risks involved if it runs out of durability. Players need to manage the durability of boats, 
particularly "Fishing Boats" and "Rafts", while also ensuring they possess the "Swimming Ability" to avoid drowning should the boat sink.

	Boat Types and Durability

	1. "Fishing Boats and Rafts"
- Usage : Primarily used for fishing and navigating smaller bodies of water.
- Durability : These boats have a limited durability that decays with use, represented by a percentage. The durability decreases over time as the boat is used, particularly when it is exposed to harsh conditions or constant movement.
    - Small Fishing Boats : Can carry 1 person, with a durability lasting approximately 5 hours of continuous use.
    - Large Fishing Boats : Can carry up to 4 people, with a durability lasting approximately 5 hours of continuous use.
- Termination Mechanic : Once the durability reaches 0%, the boat will begin to sink. The player must have the "Swimming Ability" to survive and reach safety, unless they are near shore or have a method of rescue available.

	2. "Ghost Ship Travel"
- Usage : Ghost Ships are large transport vessels used for long-distance travel between distant points across vast bodies of water. They do not serve as fishing vessels but are essential for transportation and serve as mobile platforms for NPCs.
- Durability : These boats have no durability and cannot sink. They are immune to sinking due to their supernatural nature.
    - Function : These ships are typically crewed by NPCs that can offer services such as vendors or quest givers.
- Termination Mechanic : These ships do not have a sinking mechanic since they are immune to damage.

	3. "Merchant Ships (Trading Vessels)"
- Usage : These boats are designed for transporting goods between major ports across the game world.
- Durability : Merchant ships are heavy, large, and durable, primarily stationary at ports or undertaking longer voyages.
    - Durability : These boats have stable and long-lasting durability, though durability is not a critical factor due to their minimal travel time and stationary nature.
- Termination Mechanic : These boats are not susceptible to sinking due to their robust construction.

	4. "Transport Ships"
- Usage : Transport ships are designed to carry troops and heavy equipment, often for military campaigns or large-scale operations.
- Durability : These ships have a higher durability compared to typical fishing boats but are not designed for civilian use or long-distance travel.
    - Durability : While more durable than fishing boats, transport ships are generally used for short to medium-range voyages.
- Termination Mechanic : These boats are more resilient and can withstand more wear and tear but still have a finite durability.

	5. "Warships"
- Usage : Large, military ships used primarily for combat and naval warfare. They are capable of carrying large numbers of soldiers.
- Durability : Due to their large size and military-grade construction, warships have a significantly higher durability compared to civilian vessels.
    - Durability : Warships are highly durable but are not designed for long-distance travel. They are typically used for coastal operations and military maneuvers.
- Termination Mechanic : These ships have limited durability, with potential for damage in extreme conditions, though they are significantly tougher than civilian boats.

		Durability Mechanics

	Fishing Boats and Rafts
- Durability Decay : These boats have a maximum durability rating that decays over time. The durability decreases with use, and once it is below 10%, 
players will receive a warning that the boat is about to sink.
- Swimming Ability Requirement : If the durability reaches 0%, the boat will sink, and players must have the "Swimming Ability" to swim to safety or 
risk drowning if too far from shore.

	Ghost Ships
- Immunity to Durability Loss : Ghost Ships do not have any durability and are immune to sinking. They provide a consistent, reliable form of transportation across large bodies of water.

	Swimming Ability
- Players who lack the "Swimming Ability" will struggle to survive if a boat sinks far from shore. This passive skill allows players to swim and avoid drowning, ensuring their survival when out at sea.

	Important Notes
- Ghost Ships : These ships have no durability rating and are immune to sinking.
- Fishing Boats and Rafts : Players need to carefully manage the durability of these boats, especially when engaging in long-distance travel or fishing in remote locations.
- Durability Management : For longer voyages, players should always monitor their boat’s durability and ensure they reach shore before the boat’s durability runs out.
- Swimming Ability : It is highly recommended for players to acquire the "Swimming Ability" to ensure they can survive if their boat sinks.
