			Underwater\_Currents

	Overview : Underwater\_Currents simulate natural oceanic forces that influence player movement and positioning. Found only in select underwater zones, currents 
create both challenges and opportunities for exploration, navigation, and resource gathering.

	Placement Rules
	Currents do not appear everywhere underwater. They are restricted to specific areas to create unique gameplay moments:
* "Submerged Caves" – Strong surges conceal entrances or block players until they align movement with the flow.
* "Deep Trenches" – Riptide currents pull players downward into dangerous depth zones.
* "Coral Labyrinths" – Layered currents create puzzle-like navigation through branching tunnels.
* "Near Sunken Structures" (shipwrecks, ruins, war machines) – Currents funnel around debris, guiding or obstructing entry points.
* "Hidden Passages" – Some secret zones are only reachable by letting a current drag the player through narrow openings.

	Core Functionality
* "Directional Force" : Players are passively pushed or pulled in the current’s direction.
* "Variable Strength" : Ranges from gentle drift (cosmetic) to riptide surge (rapid displacement).
* "Vertical Flow" : Some currents push upward (toward surface air pockets) or downward (into depths).
* "Layered Flow" : Multiple intersecting currents require tactical swimming paths.

	Gameplay Effects
1. "Movement Alteration" – Alters player control, requiring navigation skill.
2. "Environmental Hazard" – Can push players into hostile fauna zones, coral spikes, or fatigue waters.
3. "Exploration Tool" – Currents act as hidden paths to secret caves or chambers.
4. "Resource Challenge" – Rare herbs/fish/minerals may be placed directly within current paths.

	Strength Levels

* "Gentle Drift" – Cosmetic; adds atmosphere.
* "Steady Pull" – Noticeable push requiring correction.
* "Strong Surge" – Forces movement unless countered.
* "Riptide Current" – Rapid displacement to a preset location.

	Counterplay & Player Tools
* "Swimming Against Current" → higher stamina/fatigue drain.
* "Consumables" → Potions/buffs reduce current effect.
* "Abilities" → Movement skills counteract displacement.
* "Anchor Points" → Players can grab coral or debris to resist current.

	Integration Cues
* "Visual" → flowing seaweed, particle streams, swaying fish schools.
* "Audio" → rushing water sounds, louder with stronger currents.
* "UI" → subtle directional arrow overlay or buff icon.
