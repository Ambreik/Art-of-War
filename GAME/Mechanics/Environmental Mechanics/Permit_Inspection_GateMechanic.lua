			Permit & Document Verification System

	Core Concept

	When a player attempts to cross into "restricted areas" (gates, ports, military zones, noble districts, dungeons requiring special entry, etc.), the game 
automatically triggers an "Inspection Event Window" where their items, disguises, and permissions are verified by NPC guards or gatekeepers.
	The player cannot proceed further until this verification completes.

	Trigger Conditions

* Walking into a "zone boundary" that requires authorization (gates, city walls, docks, temples, courts, military camps, etc.).
* Attempting to interact with a restricted "NPC, door, or portal".
* Entering a scripted event tied to permits (e.g., joining a noble banquet, boarding a warship).

	Mechanics Flow

1. Auto-Stop & UI Pop-Up
   - Player is stopped in place; screen fades slightly with a dialogue box / inspection window.
   - NPC Guard or Inspector appears on screen with text (can vary by faction or location):
		“Halt! Show me your authorization to pass through here.”

2. Inventory Scan
   - The system scans the player’s inventory for a valid ticket/permit/document item.
   - Options appear in the UI:
		- Present Document (auto-shows if valid)
		- Attempt Bluff/Bribe (if outlaw mechanics allow)
		- Stay Silent (auto-deny, player refused entry)

3. Document Use & Validation
   - If a valid permit exists → it is consumed or flagged as “used” depending on its type:
		- Single-Use Permit → destroyed on validation.
		- Reusable Pass → remains but gains suspicion/inspection counters.
   - Guard responds with approval text:
		“Everything seems in order. You may pass.”
   - Gate/door opens, and player may proceed.

4. Forgery & Detection
   - If the presented item is a "Forged Document":
		- Guard rolls an inspection chance (with modifiers for rank, zone, etc.).
		- On success → pass validated.
		- On failure → guard exposes forgery:
			- “This seal is false! Seize them!”
			- Player receives "Criminal Charge"
			- Guard attacks; player forced into combat or escape.

5. No Document
   - If no valid item exists:
		- Guard refuses entry.
		- Dialogue: “No authorization? Turn back immediately, or face arrest.”
		- If player persists → forced combat with guards.

	Additional Mechanics

- Bribery (Outlaw/Criminal Option):
	- Player can offer gold or outlaw tokens to bypass inspection.
	- Bribery chance increases with player outlaw reputation.
	- Failure → doubled bounty + confiscation.

- Dialogue Variations :
	- Knight guards speak formally (“Papers, please.”).
	- Pindar guards sniff and growl (“I smell deceit… show me your writ.”).
	- Outlaw smugglers just grunt (“What’s the password?”).

- Special Cases :
	- Some areas may require multiple layers of proof (e.g., pass + disguise).
	- Magical wards or divine seals can bypass disguise items (auto-detection).
	- NPC Companions (like Guardians or Barons) may influence inspection outcomes.

- Cinematic Pause : Camera zooms slightly, focusing on guard NPC during inspection.
- Player-NPC Chat : Player can respond with scripted short lines: “Here is my permit.”, “Surely you don’t need to bother…”, etc.
- UI Glow Indicators :
	- Green glow if pass is valid.
	- Orange if forged (suspicion).
	- Red flash if caught.

	System Impact

- Encourages use of tickets/permits as a core item category.
- Makes "Forged Documents" risky but rewarding.
- Creates a natural check system for restricted areas, tying in with both lawful and outlaw playstyles.
- Provides roleplay depth: Knights must keep valid papers, Pindars sniff for lies, Outlaws forge or bribe.
