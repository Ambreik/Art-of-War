			Underwater_Walking

	Description : Underwater Walking is a movement mechanic that enables players to move as if they are on solid ground while walking across the 
seafloor. It provides an immersive experience by allowing players to interact with underwater environments without the typical restrictions of 
swimming. Unlike the swimming mechanic, which involves buoyancy and water resistance, Underwater Walking allows full land-like movement, offering 
players the freedom to explore and interact with the seafloor.
	This mechanic doesnâ€™t include water breathing (which is managed separately), the ability to eat/drink while submerged, or the ability to mount 
underwater. Players benefit from normal movement speeds (or slightly increased movement when not mounted) while on the seafloor. The mechanic is 
triggered once the player reaches the bottom of a body of water, enabling them to walk on the ocean floor.

	Examples include accessing underwater caves, discovering sunken ruins, or exploring the seafloor for rare resources or hidden monsters.
