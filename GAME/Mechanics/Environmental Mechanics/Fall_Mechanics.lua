			Fall_Mechanics  

	Details : The "Fall" mechanic is triggered when a player falls from a significant height or from an environment that causes them to lose their 
footing. The mechanic is designed to assess the height of the fall, the playerâ€™s health, and any potential mitigating factors that may reduce or 
nullify fall damage.

	Rules and Calculations :
- Fall Distance : The damage taken is based on the height from which the player falls. A fall from a minor height (e.g., less than 5 meters) will cause minimal to no damage. Falls from higher altitudes (greater than 10 meters) can result in significant damage.
- Fall Speed : The player accelerates during a fall based on gravity, with an increase in speed as the fall height increases.
- Impact Damage : Upon reaching the ground, the player will take damage that is proportional to the distance fallen. For example, a fall from 10 meters may cause minor damage, while a fall from 50 meters or more may result in severe damage or even death.
    - Fall Damage Calculation :  
      Fall Damage = Fall Distance (meters) * Factor (based on environment and player's health)**
		- Light Falls (up to 10 meters) : Low or negligible damage.  
		- Moderate Falls (10-30 meters) : Moderate damage, possibly affecting stamina or movement speed.  
		- Severe Falls (over 30 meters) : High damage, potential for debilitating effects (e.g., broken bones or temporary debuff to movement).
