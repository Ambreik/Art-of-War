			Bribery Sub-Mechanic (Outlaw Exclusive)

	Eligibility

- Only available to Outlaw-aligned players.
- Triggered during a "Permit Inspection" when:
	- The player lacks the proper permit, OR
	- The player is attempting to use a "forged permit" and detection rolls succeed.

---

	Mechanics

1. Guard Dialogue Trigger
   NPC says: “This document looks… suspicious. Care to explain yourself?”
   → Options appear:
	- Hand over the permit (default check → likely failure).
	- Attempt Bribe (Outlaw-only option).
	- Attack/Refuse (combat encounter).

2. Bribery Options
	- Gold Bribe : Fixed cost based on zone difficulty.
	- Contraband Bribe : Special outlaw items (e.g., Blood Opal, Smuggler’s Wine, Black Powder) can replace gold.
	- Faction Rank Bonus : Higher outlaw rank → lower bribe cost / higher success chance.

3. Success / Failure Chances
   - Base success: 70% (scales with outlaw rank & charisma-type stats).
   - Veteran Guards / Elite Inspectors: success reduced by 20–30%.
   - Failure results in:
		- Bribe lost.
		- Player flagged with "Wanted" status in that zone.

	Guard Behavior
- Low-rank Guards : Easier to bribe, may even hint: “Next time, come with gold upfront.”
- Elite Guards : More resistant, sometimes outright reject bribes (“You dare insult me with this?”).
- Corruptible NPCs : Specific guards (random chance) may always take bribes without failure.

---

	Integration
- Bounty Hunter System : If a bribe fails, player’s bounty increases sharply.
- Reputation : Successful bribes with certain guards may reduce scrutiny in that location for 24h (soft “corruption” memory).
- Economy : Ensures outlaws must manage outlaw-only contraband items as “bribe currency.”

	UI/UX
- Inspection screen expands with “Offer Bribe” button (only for Outlaws).
- If successful → small animation (guard pocketing coin / looking away).
- If failed → red glow, guard yells, nearby NPCs alerted.
