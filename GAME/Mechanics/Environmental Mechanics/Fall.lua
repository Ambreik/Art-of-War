			Fall

	Description : The "Fall" mechanic dictates how players interact with the environment when falling from great heights. This mechanic introduces 
consequences to gravity, where the playerâ€™s fall speed, impact damage, and possible environmental interactions play a critical role in the gameplay 
experience. Falls can be a tactical part of exploration or combat,with players needing to manage their descent or risk falling into dangerous terrain,
causing harm to their character.
	In some regions, players may use special abilities, environmental effects, or equipment to mitigate fall damage, creating opportunities for 
exploration and strategic gameplay. Whether escaping an enemy, descending a cliffside, or jumping between rooftops, the "Fall" mechanic adds a layer 
of realism, danger, and thrill to the game world.
