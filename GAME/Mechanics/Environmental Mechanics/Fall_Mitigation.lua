			Fall_Mitigation

	Details : Players can mitigate fall damage through specific equipment, abilities, or environmental conditions. These methods allow players to 
reduce or negate the damage they take from falls, adding an element of strategy to navigation and combat.

	Mitigation Methods :
- Slow Fall Abilities : Certain skills or abilities (e.g., gliding, levitation) can slow the playerâ€™s descent or reduce the impact when they land, 
making falls from significant heights safer.
- Environmental Effects : Some areas may offer natural features like water bodies, piles of hay, or soft ground that can cushion a fall, reducing or 
eliminating damage.
- Equipment and Gear : Players can equip items such as "Helmets", "Boots of Speed", or "Featherfall Potions", which may mitigate the fall damage
by absorbing the impact or distributing the force more effectively.
	- Helmets or Armor : Provides a small damage reduction based on the type of material.
    - Featherfall Potions : A consumable item that grants temporary protection against fall damage.
- Mounts or Pets : Certain flying mounts or pets may be able to catch the player mid-fall, preventing damage entirely or slowing the descent.
