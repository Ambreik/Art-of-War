	Overview : There are several methods available to delay or prevent drowning, allowing players to extend their time underwater:  

- Objects :  
  - "Air Pockets" : Certain areas feature natural air pockets (like underwater fissures or deep sea bubbles) where the player can position themselves 
to replenish breath.  
  - "Great Sea" : "Giant clams" release air and can be used to refill breath.  

- Classes :  
  - "Shaman" : The Shaman class can place the "Totem of Water" on the ground, which allows them to sustain their breath for up to 10 minutes if within
range.
