	Outcomes :  
- Seafloor Exploration : Players can access hidden areas on the ocean floor, including secret treasures, rare monsters, or resources that would 
otherwise be inaccessible.  
- Increased Movement : When not mounted, players benefit from slightly increased movement speed while walking on the seafloor, making exploration 
faster and more fluid.  
- Environmental Interaction : The mechanic opens up more dynamic environmental interactions, such as searching for underwater artifacts or engaging 
with seafloor-specific NPCs or creatures.  
- Completion of Underwater Quests : Many quests, particularly those related to underwater exploration or resource gathering, can only be completed 
with the ability to walk on the seafloor.
