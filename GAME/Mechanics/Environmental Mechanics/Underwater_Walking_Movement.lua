			Underwater_Walking_Movement

	Details :  
- Activation : The mechanic is activated once the player character reaches the seafloor in a body of water deep enough to trigger the movement change.
Upon reaching the bottom, the movement changes from swimming to walking.  
- Movement Speed : Movement speed on the seafloor is equivalent to normal walking speed or slightly increased when not mounted (depending on the 
player’s equipment or abilities).  
- Animation : The character’s movement is animated as if walking on land, with appropriate adjustments for terrain types found at the seafloor 
(e.g., sand, rocks, coral).  
- Terrain Interaction : The character will interact with environmental obstacles like rocks, coral, and submerged ruins in the same way as land 
terrain but adjusted for the underwater context.
