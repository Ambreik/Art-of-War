	Description : A "Corpse" represents the dead body of a character, NPC, or monster. Corpses serve various gameplay purposes, such as interacting 
with quests, providing loot, or marking key locations in the game world. The behavior and duration of corpses depend on their origin.

- Player Corpses : Dead player characters maintain their normal shape in a lying position until they resurrect.  
- NPC/Mob Corpses : NPC and monster corpses usually remain for a short duration (up to 5 seconds) before decaying and disappearing. However, some 
corpses can be looted and may last longer.  
- Lootable Corpses : Corpses that can be looted (e.g., via "Skinning") remain for up to 15 seconds, with a silver shine to indicate they are 
interactable. Once looted, they disappear.
