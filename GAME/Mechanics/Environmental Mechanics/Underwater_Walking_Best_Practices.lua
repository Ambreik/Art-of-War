			Underwater_Walking_Best_Practices

	Guidelines :  
- Exploration : Use Underwater Walking to explore sunken cities,underwater caves, and other seafloor locations without the usual swimming restriction.
- Resource Gathering : This mechanic is ideal for collecting underwater resources like minerals, plants, or special materials that are only accessible
at the seafloor.  
- Be Aware of Depth : Ensure that the player is at the appropriate depth before attempting to walk on the seafloor. Use environmental markers (e.g., 
seaweed or coral) to indicate when the player has reached the seafloor.  
- Seafloor Combat : Be cautious when exploring hostile underwater zones, as many monsters in these areas may require additional preparation, such as 
water-breathing potions or defensive gear.
