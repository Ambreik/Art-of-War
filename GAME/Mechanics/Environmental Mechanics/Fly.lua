		Fly

	Description : The "Fly" mechanic allows players to traverse the skies, bypassing the terrain below, using special flying mounts or the Zeppelin 
travel system. This mechanic enhances mobility and exploration, enabling players to reach new heights and distant locations quickly. It is accessible 
through "Flying Mounts", which can be summoned by players with the appropriate skill level, and the Zeppelin travel system, a one-way 
transportation system that connects specific regions. While flying, players are immune to most ground-based threats and obstacles, though air-based 
challenges may still arise.
	Flying is only available in specific zones and with the use of special mounts or vehicles, adding an extra layer of excitement and exclusivity. 
Flying significantly enhances the gameplay experience, allowing for faster travel between continents and regions, as well as opening up new aerial 
combat opportunities.
