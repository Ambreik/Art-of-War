			Underwater_Walking_Notes

	Additional Information :  
- Synergy with Swimming : While this mechanic allows walking on the seafloor, players will still need swimming mechanics to reach the bottom in the first place. It is recommended to have both systems complement each other for a more seamless experience.  
- Environmental Variations : Some underwater locations may limit or enhance the Underwater Walking mechanic based on local environmental factors 
(e.g., heavy underwater currents may reduce movement speed or cause slippage).  
- Special Abilities : Certain abilities or equipment, like underwater armor or enhanced fins, may provide bonuses or abilities while using Underwater 
Walking, such as increased movement speed or the ability to interact with seafloor creatures more efficiently.
