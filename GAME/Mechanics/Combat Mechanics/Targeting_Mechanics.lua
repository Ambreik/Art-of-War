			Targeting_Mechanics

	Mechanics :  
1. Target Selection :  
	- Players can target another character, NPC, or object by clicking on it or using the `/target [name]` command.  
	- Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Tab) can be used to cycle through nearby targets.  

2. Target Types :  
	- Friendly Targets : Includes party members, friendly NPCs, or allied players. Friendly targeting enables interactions like healing, buffing, or 
trading.  
	- Hostile Targets : Includes enemies (NPCs or players) that can be attacked or debuffed.  

3. Auto-Targeting :  
	- When no target is selected, initiating an ability will automatically target the nearest eligible entity (depending on the abilityâ€™s type).  
	- Priority rules ensure that hostile targets are selected over friendly or neutral ones for offensive abilities.  

4. Target Indicators :  
	- A glowing outline or an overhead marker is used to highlight the current target. Customizable in settings.
