	Advanced Features :  
1. Target Cycling :  
   - The "Tab" key can be used to cycle through available targets. This is especially useful during combat to quickly change targets, often focusing 
on the nearest hostile units.  
   - Focus Targeting : Players can set a “focus” target through the interface, which is useful for managing combat in large-scale fights. The focus 
target is indicated with a special symbol or a highlighted border.  
   
2. Vehicle and Mount Targeting :  
	- Mounts that are being ridden by players are generally not selected directly. Instead, the character will be selected. However, some mounted mobs
or special vehicles can be selected separately.  
	- Players can still interact with the vehicle or mount by selecting the rider (player) or using the **Tab** key.

3. Obstructed Targeting :  
	- In some cases, other objects or units may obstruct the view of a target, making it hard to select them. In these cases, the **Tab** key or 
changing camera angles may assist in targeting.  
	- Target Prioritization : The system will prioritize selecting targets that are closer and in the player’s line of sight, even if obstructions are
present.
