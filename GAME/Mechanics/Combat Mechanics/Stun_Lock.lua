			Stun_Lock
	
	Overview : Stun Lock refers to a combat mechanic where a target is incapacitated for a period of time due to a series of stun effects applied 
consecutively, often resulting in the target being unable to act or respond during the duration of the stun chain. This mechanic is used by both 
players and high-level NPCs or monsters, including World Bosses or Notorious Monsters.

		Additional Notes  
		
	Counterplay Mechanics : Players, NPCs, and monsters may use specific strategies to break or avoid stun locks. These include timed abilities, 
positioning, or specialized gear.

	Duration and Stacking : The duration of a stun lock can vary depending on the ability used. Stun effects may stack, making it more difficult to 
escape the lock without specific counters.
	Immunity and Resistance : Characters, NPCs, and monsters may have immunity or resistance to stun locks based on their level, buffs, debuffs, or 
special abilities.
