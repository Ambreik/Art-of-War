	Mechanics :  
1. Initiating Select :  
   - "Left-click" on an NPC, player, or mob to select it. This does not engage in combat but identifies the unit as the player's target.  
   - "Right-click" also selects a target but additionally allows for initiating combat or other interactions. For instance, right-clicking on a 
hostile NPC typically starts combat.  
   - "Tab key" can be used to cycle through available targets in the player’s vicinity, with the focus typically on attackable or interactable units. 
This can be useful when multiple enemies or NPCs are near the player.  
   - Macros and Commands : Players can create macros to select specific targets using the `/target` command, which can be linked to key bindings for 
ease of use. This is especially useful for quickly targeting key NPCs or players.

2. Target Visibility and Indicators :  
	- Once a unit is selected, it is visually indicated by a circle around the unit and the name of the unit above its head.  
	- Hostility Indicators : The color of the selection circle and the name’s color represent the target's hostility:
		- "Red" : Aggressive (hostile NPC or player)
		- "Yellow" : Neutral, but will become hostile if attacked
		- "Green" : Non-combatant, often friendly NPCs or passive mobs  
	- The portrait of the selected unit appears near the player’s portrait on the screen, providing quick access to further interactions.
