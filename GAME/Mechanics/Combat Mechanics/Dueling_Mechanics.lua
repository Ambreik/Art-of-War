1. Initiating a Duel :  
   - Right-click on a player's portrait and select "Duel."  
   - A Duel flag will drop from the sky, and the opponent must accept for the duel to begin. A countdown will show the time remaining before the duel starts.  
   - Alternatively, use the command `/duel` while targeting the opponent. This is useful for creating macros for dueling.  

2. Dueling Restrictions :  
   - Dueling is disabled in most capital cities and dungeons.  
   - Attempting to duel in these areas triggers an on-screen notification: "Dueling isn't allowed here."  
   - **Exception : The Underworld Realm allows dueling.
