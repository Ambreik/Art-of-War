			Interrupt

	"Interrupt" refers to the act of slowing or stopping a target's spellcasting process. It can occur through two primary methods:

1. Interruption Caused by Damage (Pushback)
2. Interruption Caused by Specific Abilities

	1. Interruption Caused by Damage (Pushback)

	Whenever a damaging spell or ability hits a caster mid-cast, it causes "pushback"—this means the cast time is delayed or slowed, forcing the
caster to spend more time completing their spell. 

- "Channelled Spells": Unlike cast-time spells,channelled spells are shortened by pushback(causing them to finish early without reaching full effect),
rather than delayed. This reduces the efficiency of both the spell's effect and the caster's mana use.
- "Effect" : Pushback will slow cast-time spells but won’t have any effect on "Damage-over-Time" (DoT) or most channelled spells, which do not 
experience interruption.

	2. Interruption Caused by Specific Abilities

	Certain abilities are specifically designed to interrupt spellcasting immediately, regardless of the current state of the cast. When a spell 
is interrupted in this way:

- The spell is immediately cancelled.
- The cast time bar will turn "red" with the message "Interrupted".
- "Mana" is not consumed if the spell is interrupted mid-cast.
- "Global cooldowns" are cancelled, allowing the caster to cast another spell instantly.

		Interrupt Abilities

	Interrupt abilities are specialized moves that can immediately halt another caster’s spellcasting. These abilities typically do not cause damage,
are instant-cast, and are unaffected by the global cooldown, allowing them to be used anytime.

- Counterspell Effect : Successfully interrupting a spell with an interrupt ability applies a counterspell effect, preventing the target from casting 
any spells for a set duration (measured in seconds).
- Visual Effects : The interrupted caster will see visual cues indicating the interruption, and the counterspell effect will appear as a mini-debuff 
on their status bar.
- Debuff : This debuff cannot be dispelled, making it a powerful tool for controlling enemies.
  
	Interrupt Skill : The interrupt ability, known as "Strike", can be learned at level 35 from a "Class Teacher" in "Middlean Islands". It is 
available to all classes but only unlocks in this specific region.

	Instant Cast Spells

- "Instant cast spells" cannot be interrupted since they do not have a cast time. 
- While other forms of control (such as "silences" or "stuns") can prevent instant-cast abilities, these spells are immune to the interruption effect.
