			Focus_Target

	Description : The "Focus Target" system is an additional layer to the standard target management system in the game. It allows players to keep 
track of a secondary target while still maintaining their primary focus on their main target. This system is particularly useful in situations where 
players need to manage multiple threats, healing assignments, or coordinated attacks.

	Key Sections :

	1. Focus Target Mechanics

	Overview :
- The Focus Target provides players with the ability to designate a secondary target (different from their primary target). This system allows players
to track this secondary target, monitor its health, and issue commands such as attacks or heals without switching focus away from their main target.
  
- Focus Targeting :  
	Players can assign a focus target by selecting a unit and then using a hotkey or command to set it as the focus. Once a unit is marked as the 
focus, it can be quickly recalled through hotkeys, providing more flexibility for the player in both combat and support roles.

- Target Memory :  
	The focus target acts as a "target memory," meaning that once set, the focus remains until changed by the player. This is beneficial in dynamic 
combat situations where players might need to switch back to a previously selected target quickly.

	2. Focus Target Functions

- Secondary Targeting :  
	Players can maintain both a primary target and a secondary focus target. The focus target does not need to be directly in the player's line of 
sight or range to be selected, making it easier to manage off-screen or distant units, such as enemies, allies, or NPCs.
  
- Tracking and Management :  
	Focused targets are displayed on the UI, often in a separate panel or section of the player’s HUD, where players can see health, status effects, 
and other important information. This ensures the player always has quick access to the secondary target's current state.
  
- Hotkeys and Recall :  
	Once a focus target is set, it can be recalled using a hotkey or a specific command. Players can quickly switch focus between the primary and 
focus targets during combat or while moving. This allows the player to maintain a fluid gameplay experience without losing control of key elements in 
a battle.

	3. Combat and Healing with Focus Target

- Attacks and Spells :  
	Players can use focus-targeted abilities or spells that specifically affect the secondary target. For example, a healer may target the tank 
(primary) while using healing spells on the focus target, or a DPS player may focus on dealing damage to a boss while managing adds or debuffs on 
another enemy or ally.
  
- Heal Assignments :  
	Healers often use the focus target to monitor and heal secondary targets such as off-tanks or players in specific roles that need extra attention.
This allows for better coordination during complex battles.

- Coordination with Allies :  
	The focus target system is beneficial in team-oriented content, such as raids or group content. By assigning focus to specific targets, players 
can coordinate with teammates to focus on particular enemies, NPCs, or mechanics.

	4. Focus Target UI and Display

- Focus Target Display :  
	Once set, the focus target is displayed clearly in the player's UI, typically showing important information like health, buffs/debuffs, and any 
relevant status effects (e.g., stunned, poisoned, etc.).
  
- Visual Indicators :  
	The focus target’s health bar and status effects may be shown next to the player’s main health bar or in a separate UI element, providing at-a-
glance information. This can also be color-coded to represent the urgency or importance of the target (e.g., red for enemies, green for healing).

	5. Switching Focus Targets

- Manual Switching :  
	Players can manually switch the focus target by selecting a new target and using the hotkey to assign it as the focus. This is ideal for dynamic 
situations where the player needs to adapt quickly to changing combat scenarios.
  
- Automatic Switching :  
	Some abilities or in-game events may automatically switch the player’s focus target. For example, if an enemy casts a debuff on a party member, 
the system may suggest setting that player as the focus to provide healing or dispels quickly.
