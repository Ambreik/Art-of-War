			Linked\_Aggro

	Overview : Linked\_Aggro is a combat mechanic where disturbing ambient wildlife or certain creatures can alert and chain-aggro nearby hostile mobs. This creates
dynamic and sometimes chaotic combat encounters, rewarding careful pulls and situational awareness.
	The system ensures that some areas of the world feel more alive and dangerous, preventing “safe farming” in dense wildlife zones.

	Core Functionality

	1. "Trigger Event"
* Player action disturbs an ambient group (birds, monkeys, insects, small critters, etc.).
* Trigger can also occur if a designated “scout mob” spots the player.

	2. "Alert Broadcast"
* Disturbed wildlife generates a "noise radius" (configurable per mob type).
* All hostile creatures within this radius are placed into combat-ready state.

	3. "Chain Aggro Reaction"
* If any hostile mob enters combat, nearby linked mobs are also aggroed.
* This chain can cascade across packs if positioning overlaps.

	Gameplay Effects
* Careless Pulls Become Risky → Pulling near wildlife can accidentally trigger multi-pack engagements.
* Strategic Planning → Players learn to clear scouts/critters first before pulling a camp.
* Immersion → Makes jungle, forest, and ruins feel alive and dangerous.

	Design Variants
* Bird Flocks → Fly up noisily when disturbed, alerting nearby mobs.
* Monkey Troops → Scream and throw debris, marking players for aggro.
* Scout Mobs (humanoids or beasts) → Run toward nearby packs to trigger linked aggro.
* Insect Swarms → Create buzzing noise radius, pulling predators nearby.

	System Rules
* Noise Radius :
  * Birds → Medium radius (15–20m).
  * Monkeys → Large radius (20–30m).
  * Scouts → Targeted (run directly to pack).
* Cooldown : Each ambient group can only be disturbed once every X minutes.
* Scaling : Stronger mobs (e.g., elites) less likely to be tied into linked aggro to prevent unfair wipes.
* Faction Neutrality : Works the same across all player factions.

	Counterplay & Player Tools
* Stealth : Rogues/Assassins can bypass without triggering ambient wildlife.
* Ranged Pulls : Skilled ranged pulling can avoid wildlife trigger zones.
* Crowd Control : Stunning or silencing scouts before they alert others cancels chain.
* Environmental Awareness : Learning wildlife patterns allows safe navigation.

	Integration Examples

*Dense Jungles → Monkeys screaming in trees trigger nearby predator packs.
*Ruins → Birds disturbed from statues alert cultist mobs.
*Camp Guards → Scout NPC runs to sound alarm if not killed quickly.

	UI/Feedback 
* Visual: Birds flying off, monkeys jumping, scouts raising torches.
* Audio: Loud screeches, alarm calls, or buzzing.
* Combat Log: “Your presence has disturbed nearby wildlife!”
