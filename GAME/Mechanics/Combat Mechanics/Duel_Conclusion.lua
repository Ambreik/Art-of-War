	Ending a Duel :  
1. Victory Conditions :  
   - A duel ends when one player reaches one hit point, signaling their defeat. The system announces: "<winning_player_name> has defeated <losing_player_name> in a duel."  
   - Players can sometimes die after the duel ends, especially if there are delayed damage effects, like a Warlock's DoT (damage over time) spells.  
   
2. Fleeing :  
   - A duel ends if a player moves too far away from the Duel Flag. The system will announce: "<fleeing_player_name> has fled a duel with <remaining_player_name>."  
   - Players can forfeit a duel by typing `/forfeit` or `/yield`.
