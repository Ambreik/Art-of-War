			Flying_Mounts

	Details : Flying Mounts are special mounts that grant the player the ability to fly within designated zones. These mounts come in various forms, 
from majestic dragons to mechanical constructs, and can be summoned and dismissed at will. Flying Mounts are typically obtained through quests, 
crafting, or as rare drops from special encounters.

	Rules and Limitations :
- Activation : Players must possess a "Flying Mount" to activate flying. Once summoned, the mount can carry the player through the skies, bypassing all ground-based terrain and obstacles.
- Zones of Use : Flying Mounts are only usable in specific areas, such as "Legrand Continent" and regions with designated flying zones. Players can 
not fly in dungeons, cities, or most other areas where flight would disrupt gameplay balance.
- Flight Duration : Flight is continuous while mounted, with no limit on how long players can stay airborne. However, certain air-based hazards or 
conditions may affect flight ability.
- Combat and Mounting : Players cannot engage in combat while flying, and once dismounted, the player must wait a short cooldown before being able to 
summon the mount again.
- Speed and Elevation : Flying Mounts offer a significant increase in movement speed compared to land travel. Players can ascend, descend, and move 
horizontally in the air freely, providing a strategic advantage for exploration and escaping ground-based threats.
