	Description : This section focuses on NPCs that use spells. These may include spellcasters like wizards, sorcerers, or priests. NPCs can cast 
spells that affect either the player or other NPCs, including buffs, debuffs, healing, and elemental damage. NPC spells are similar to player spells 
but are often adapted to the NPC's role or class.
