			NPC_Swim

- AI Behavior : NPCs will automatically switch to swimming when they enter water, based on their specific AI behavior. Certain NPCs may swim at 
different speeds depending on their species (e.g., aquatic creatures move faster in water than land-based creatures).

- Aggressive Swimming : Hostile NPCs may chase players into water, using the swim mechanics to engage in combat. These NPCs may have specialized 
abilities in the water (e.g., increased damage, environmental control).
