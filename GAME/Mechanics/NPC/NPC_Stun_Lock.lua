			NPC_Stun_Lock
			
	Description : NPCs (Non-Player Characters) may apply stun locks in certain combat scenarios, particularly those involving higher-tier NPCs like 
elite enemies, faction leaders, or dungeon bosses. NPCs may use stuns strategically to incapacitate the player or other NPCs.
	Abilities Affected :  
*NPCs use a variety of spells or abilities that apply stun effects, especially those in raid encounters or high-level dungeons. For example, a Dungeon
Boss may chain multiple stuns to incapacitate the player team.
	Strategic Use :  
*Some NPCs, particularly those in dungeons or world bosses, are designed to use stun locks to disrupt the flow of combat, requiring players to 
strategize and use specific countermeasures (e.g., "Stun Break" abilities or gear).
	AI Mechanics :  
*NPCs are programmed to apply stuns in certain combat situations, often in response to player actions or as part of a set attack sequence. NPCs are 
typically more intelligent when using stuns as part of a strategy to control the pace of combat.
