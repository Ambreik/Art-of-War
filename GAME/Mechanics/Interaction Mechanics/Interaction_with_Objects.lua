			Interaction_with_Objects

	Details : The core function of the "Use" mechanic is the player's ability to interact with objects or items in the world. When an item is 
clicked, it triggers a specific action that typically results in an effect. These interactions are generally context-sensitive, meaning the item or 
device being interacted with determines the outcome of the action.  

- Items : A player can use items from their inventory, such as potions, weapons, or scrolls.
- Devices : Fixed devices in the world, such as doors, levers, or machines, can be interacted with to trigger specific results.
- NPCs : Some NPCs have a "Use" function, such as the ability to talk, receive a quest, or buy/sell goods.
