	Guidelines : 
- Timing : In multiplayer contexts, ensure that using items or interacting with the environment is done at the right time to avoid disrupting group 
objectives. For instance, using an item that triggers a global cooldown at the wrong time can cause delays.
- Efficiency : When using items in combat, consider the order of item usage, such as using a healing potion only when your health drops below a 
certain threshold to avoid wasting resources.
- Avoid Overuse : Some interactions or item uses can be exploited if abused. For example, spamming consumables may create imbalance in combat 
scenarios.
