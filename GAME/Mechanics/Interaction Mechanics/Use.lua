			Use
			
	Description : The "Use" mechanic allows players to interact with fixed devices, objects, or items to produce a desired (or undesired) effect. This
mechanic encompasses all actions in the game that involve interacting with something directlyâ€”such as using items, interacting with NPCs, opening 
chests, or activating environmental objects. These actions can range from mundane activities, like eating or drinking, to more complex interactions, 
like casting a spell or engaging in combat. The "Use" mechanic ensures that the world feels dynamic, with players continuously interacting with their 
environment to solve problems or advance objectives.  
	Examples include:
- Checking your in-game mail system.
- Drinking potions for health restoration.
- Attacking with weapons.
- Using scrolls for various effects.
