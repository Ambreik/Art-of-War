			Target

	Overview : In "World Game", the concept of targeting refers to the process by which players or NPCs designate units, locations, or objectives as 
their "target" for abilities, attacks, buffs, and healing. Targeting plays a critical role in combat, as well as in strategic decision-making during 
quests and objectives.

	The primary target can be a unit (player, NPC, enemy, etc.), an area (for Area of Effect spells), or even an object (for specific in-game interactions).

		Target Selection

	Target selection refers to the act of choosing which unit, area, or object will be the focus of the player’s or NPC's current actions.

- Player Targeting : Players can select a target from various units, including NPCs, enemy mobs, other players, or themselves. Targeting can be done manually via the game interface or through specific in-game commands or abilities.
  
- NPC Targeting : NPCs do not have a direct user interface for selecting targets. Instead, their AI determines the target based on predefined rules such as threat level, distance, or interaction triggers (e.g., healing or attacking another NPC).

- Selection Methods :  
    - Manual Targeting : Players can manually select a target by clicking on a unit, using the "Tab" key to cycle through valid targets, or using special abilities that auto-select the nearest or highest-priority target.
    - Auto-Targeting : Certain abilities may automatically select a target based on context, such as "nearest enemy" or "lowest health."

	Types of Targets

1. Primary Target :
	- The primary target is the main unit or location that an ability, spell, or attack is directed toward.
	- Examples include the player’s current focus in combat or the destination for an Area of Effect (AoE) spell.

2. Secondary Targets :
	- Some abilities have secondary effects that target units or locations near the primary target.
	- Examples include chain spells, cleave attacks, or healing spells that affect additional units within range.

3. Self-Targeting :
	- Some abilities are self-targeted, meaning the player automatically targets themselves, either for buffs, healing, or other self-centered 
abilities.

4. Area of Effect (AoE) Targets :
	- Abilities that affect an area on the ground (e.g., fireball, poison cloud) have a primary target area, with all units in that area being 
affected by the spell's effects. These units are considered secondary targets.
	- The primary target for AoE spells is the location on the ground where the ability is cast, not a specific unit.

5. Strategic Objective Targets :
	- Some quests or objectives designate a target, which could be an NPC, location, or even a large object (like a fortress or resource point).
	- These are typically used in larger scale events, sieges, or strategic objectives.

		Target Validity

	Not all targets are valid for every type of ability. The validity of a target is determined by various factors, including:

- Attackable Targets : Certain friendly or neutral NPCs cannot be attacked by players unless specific conditions are met (e.g., the player is at war 
with that faction, or the NPC is flagged for PvP).
- Invalid Targets : Units marked as unattackable (such as certain friendly NPCs, certain objects, or non-PvP flagged players) cannot be the target of 
offensive abilities, and attempting to do so will result in an "Invalid Target" error.

- Valid Healing Targets : While players cannot attack friendly units that are unattackable,they can still target them with healing and buffing spells.
These spells are only allowed on valid, friendly targets.

	Auto-Targeting and Threat

- Aggro & Threat Management : In combat, NPCs (both hostile and friendly) determine their target based on threat levels. Hostile NPCs typically target
the unit with the most threat, which is usually the player dealing the most damage.
- Player Auto-Targeting : If a player does not have a target selected and is attacked by an NPC, the attacker will be automatically selected as the 
target. If no target is selected when an offensive ability is used, the game will auto-target the nearest valid enemy.

	Special Targeting Considerations

1. Guardians and Barons :
	- Guardians and Barons are special units that can be targeted in the game, either for combat or strategic purposes. These units are often central 
to quests, objectives, or major battles.
	- Players may be able to target and interact with them through specific mechanics, such as using certain abilities, or may need to defeat them in 
combat.

2. Targeting Multiple Units :
	- Some abilities allow players to target multiple units at once. These abilities are usually area-based or allow the caster to target a group of 
units sequentially (e.g., chain lightning or mass healing).

	Targeting Restrictions and Limitations

- PvP Targets : Players engaged in PvP (Player vs. Player) combat can target other players within their faction or opposing factions, depending on the
flags and reputation status.
- Factional Targets : Units of opposite factions may be targeted only if the player is at war with them or if the unit is flagged for PvP.
- Environmental Targets : Some targets include non-living entities such as doors, siege weapons, or resource points. These targets can be interacted 
with using specific abilities or quests.

	Targeting UI/UX

- Visual Indicators : Units that can be targeted are typically highlighted in some way (e.g., outlined or marked with an icon). This allows players to
easily identify potential targets.
- Targeting Feedback : Once a target is selected, the game provides feedback such as a nameplate, health bar, or combat indicator, making it easier 
for the player to track the target during interactions.

		Conclusion

	Targeting is a crucial aspect of both combat and interaction in "World Game". It governs how players and NPCs focus their abilities, spells, and 
attacks on different targets, including enemies, allies, and even locations. Proper understanding and management of targeting mechanics are vital for 
success in combat and achieving in-game objectives.
