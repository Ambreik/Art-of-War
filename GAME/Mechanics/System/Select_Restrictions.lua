	Considerations :  
1. Selection in Combat :  
	- When a player is engaged in combat, they are often locked into combat mode with the target they’ve selected. This means they cannot freely 
select other units without first disengaging.  
   
2. Non-interactable Units :  
	- Some units or objects cannot be selected directly (e.g., destructible objects, environment items). In such cases, players must use other 
mechanics, such as environmental actions, to interact or trigger specific events.  
   
3. Target of Target :  
	- If “Target of Target” is enabled, players can see the selected target of their currently selected target, which is particularly useful for 
healing or support roles. This option can be toggled in the interface settings.
