			Spell_School

	Description : Spells in the game are divided into schools of magic, each representing a type of magical power. These schools affect the spell's 
damage, resistance, and effectiveness:
	- Earth : Focused on physical damage or manipulation of the earth.
	- Water : Spells that control water, freeze targets, or heal.
	- Fire : Fire-based damage and area-of-effect spells.
	- Wind : Spells that manipulate wind for crowd control or damage.
	- Light : Healing and protective spells or buffs.
	- Dark : Harmful spells, debuffs, or curses.
	Additional Notes : Spells effectiveness can vary based on the target's resistance to a particular school of magic 
(e.g., a fire-based monster is more resistant to fire spells).
