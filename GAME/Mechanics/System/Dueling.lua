	Description : Dueling allows players in the PvE environment to engage in consensual one-on-one combat. Players from opposing factions may duel, 
but it is primarily intended for dueling players of the same faction. Duels serve as a way to test skills, challenge friends, or practice without 
rewards beyond the thrill of victory.
