File Name : Death  
Folder : Gameplay Mechanics  

	Description : Death occurs when a character's health reaches zero or less. Once dead, a player cannot take any actions until they are resurrected 
or release their spirit. Dead players do not leave a corpse where they died. Upon death, players are given several resurrection options, each with 
different waiting times and requirements.

Key Mechanics :
- Resurrect Here : Allows the player to resurrect at their death location. Requires a wait time of up to 5 seconds initially. If the character dies again within 150 seconds, the wait time increases to 10 seconds.
- Resurrect in Town : The player can choose to resurrect at the nearest settlement, such as a village, town, main city, or tavern. Requires a 30-second wait time.
- Resurrect in Graveyard : This option requires the player to use an item called "Immortality from Underworld." Resurrection takes up to 60 seconds.
