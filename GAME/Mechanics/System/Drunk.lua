		Drunk	

	1. Overview  
File Name : Drunk  
Folder : System  

	Description : The "Drunk" condition is a severe state of inebriation that escalates beyond "Tipsy." Players enter this condition by consuming 
multiple alcoholic beverages in quick succession without letting prior effects wear off. It impairs character functionality and introduces gameplay 
quirks for immersion and challenge. If overindulged, it can lead to extreme effects, including "Drunken Vomit" or even death.
