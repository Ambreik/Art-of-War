			Fatigue

	Introduction : Fatigue is a condition that affects any character traveling through or over water that is too deep. This mechanic is designed to 
impose limitations on players to prevent them from traveling too far out into the sea or certain water regions that are not intended to be accessed 
without specific means (such as teleportation or ship travel). It primarily affects characters when they swim in regions with increasing water depth.

	Description :

- Fatigue Bar :  
	The Fatigue Bar is introduced when a player enters deep water. The deeper the water, the faster the Fatigue Bar depletes. The bar functions 
similarly to the Breath Bar, but it depletes much faster. When the Fatigue Bar reaches zero, it deals damage to the player. Fatigue can occur 
regardless of the player's position in the water (whether swimming, diving, walking on water, or flying over a fatigue region).

- Fatigue Damage :  
	Fatigue damage is shown in the Combat Log, with a system message indicating the player has received damage due to fatigue. The damage is set to 
20% of the player's maximum HP every 5 seconds while in a Fatigue zone.  
  < System Message Example > : "You received Fatigue Damage, go back to safety!"

- Safety Zones :  
	Players can avoid Fatigue damage by swimming back toward shallower waters, where the Fatigue Bar will refill. However, some areas are dangerous to
approach, as they may have barriers or other mechanics that prevent survival.

	Key Features :

- Visual Indicators :  
	Players can identify Fatigue regions by the darker color of the water and the slope of the sea floor. The minimap also displays these regions.

- Mana Regeneration :  
	While in a Fatigue zone, mana regeneration ceases, making it difficult to heal or recover while submerged. Some spells and abilities, however, may
help mitigate this effect temporarily.

- Fatigue Zones :  
	Not all bodies of water cause fatigue. For example, inland lakes and rivers are exempt from fatigue mechanics. However, players must carefully 
avoid deep sea areas that trigger the fatigue condition.

	Combat and Movement :

- Survival Mechanic :  
	The Fatigue system serves as a natural boundary to prevent players from exploring deep-sea areas that aren't meant to be accessed. Despite the 
ability to survive in these areas for some time, there is a maximum depth at which all characters will be killed, even if they avoid the fatigue 
damage long enough.

- Fatigue Damage Reduction :  
	The damage can be reduced by removing gear or buffs that provide bonus HP or stamina. However, doing so might leave the player vulnerable to mana 
loss, making it challenging to survive without external healing sources.
