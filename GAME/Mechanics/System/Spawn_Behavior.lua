			Spawn_Behavior

	Key Mechanics:  
1. Aggro Delay :  
	- Newly spawned mobs remain stationary for 5 seconds before becoming active, giving players time to evade unexpected aggro.  

2. Dynamic Respawning :  
	- Areas with heavy player traffic adjust spawn rates to maintain a balanced gameplay experience.  

3. Event-Based Spawns :  
	- Certain spawns trigger based on player actions, such as completing objectives, entering a zone, or interacting with specific objects.
