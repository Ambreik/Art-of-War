			Target
			
	Description : The "Target" mechanic governs how players and NPCs interact with each other within the game world through targeting. It defines how 
a target is selected, what actions can be performed, and how targeting interacts with combat, abilities, and other systems. This mechanic also 
includes rules for friendly and hostile targeting, targeting prioritization, and auxiliary features like assist targeting.
