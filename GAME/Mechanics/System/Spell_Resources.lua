			Spell_Resources
			
	Description : Spells typically consume mana or energy resources. Certain powerful spells may require additional resources, such as corpses for 
necromantic spells or specific environmental conditions for elemental magic. This section outlines how resource consumption works in spellcasting.
	Additional Notes : Spellcasting consumes mana, but some spells may have additional requirements, such as using a corpse 
(for necromancy-based spells) or other unique components.
