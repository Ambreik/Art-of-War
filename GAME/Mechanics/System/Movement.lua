			Movement  

	Movement Overview : In "World Game," movement speed can be toggled between two default states: "Run" and "Walk". The system includes various 
movement speeds for both characters and mounts. These speeds can be influenced by buffs, debuffs, items, and abilities, affecting overall gameplay.

	Default Movement Speeds

1. "Run" – Default speed for characters, set to 7 yards (or meters) per second.
	- Running is the primary movement speed for most gameplay situations.

2. "Walk" – Set to 2.5 yards (or meters) per second, about 35.7% of the run speed.
	- Walking is used for precision movement, roleplaying, or navigating difficult terrain without falling off edges.
	- Ground mounts and grounded flying mounts will also move at walk speed while the player is walking.

   "Trivia" :
	- Walking Speed : 2.5 yd/s | 5.11 mph | 2.5 m/s | 5.11 km/h
	- Running Speed : 7 yd/s | 14.32 mph | 7 m/s | 14.32 km/h

3. "Sprint" - Press and hold the 'SHIFT' key to make your character sprint. 
	- Sprinting will consume your character's Stamina. When your Stamina is fully drained you will automatically stop sprinting.
	- Sprint can also be used while traveling with a mount.
	- Set to double the speed of "Run".

	Mechanics of Movement

1. "Changing Speeds"  
   Movement speed can be changed dynamically depending on whether a character is running or walking. Buffs, debuffs, mounts, and abilities can 
influence these speeds.

2. "Movement Speed Effects"  
   - Increasing Speed : Buffs, items, and spells can increase run or mounted speeds.
   - Decreasing Speed : Debuffs from attacks, effects, and status conditions can slow movement speeds. 

3. "Sneaking and Dodging"
	- Pressing the 'CTRL' key will make your character take sneak position.
	- Sneaking reduces the chance that non-player characters and hostiles will detect you while in forest areas.
	- Sneaking allows you to gain critical strikes on hostiles while you are undetected.
	- Sneaking will consume Stamina while your character is moving.

		Daze Mechanics (Movement Speed Reduction)

	When a player is attacked from behind by mobs, there is a chance for the player to be "Dazed", causing a reduction in movement speed and 
dismounting the player if mounted. The Daze chance varies depending on the mob's level:

- Gray Mobs (5-10+ levels below) – 0% chance
- Green Mobs (4-9 levels below) – 10% chance
- Yellow Mobs (2 levels above/below) – 20% chance
- Orange Mobs (3-4 levels above) – 30% chance
- Red Mobs (4+ levels above) – 40% chance
