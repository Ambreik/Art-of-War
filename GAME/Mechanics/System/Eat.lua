			Eat

	Overview : "Eat" represents the action of consuming food to restore health, mana, energy, stamina, or gain temporary buffs. Typically, the 
character must sit to eat, which contrasts with drinking, which can often be done while standing or moving. Eating is essential for recovery, 
especially after combat or resource-expensive activities.

	Basic Mechanics

1. Activation :
   - Consuming a food item triggers the eating action.
   - Seated Requirement : Characters must be seated to begin eating, ensuring safe and uninterrupted consumption.
   - Time Consumption : Eating takes a short time (varies depending on the food), and it cannot be interrupted unless the character is attacked.

2. Recovery :
   - Health Restoration : Most food restores health, with varying degrees depending on the food item.
   - Mana/Energy/Stamina Restoration : Certain food items restore these resources, which are needed for specific character actions (spells, physical abilities, etc.).
   - Buffs : Some food provides temporary stat boosts or other advantages, like increased strength, defense, or critical chance.

	Mechanics of Eating

1. Sitting Down :
   - Players must be seated to start eating. This mechanic is to ensure that characters can safely recover without interruption.
   
2. Food Consumables :
   - Stackable : Some food items are stackable, allowing players to carry and consume them when needed.
   - Unique Effects : Higher-tier foods may provide unique or stronger effects, such as longer-lasting buffs or larger health restorations.

3. Eating During Combat :
   - Not Allowed : Generally, players cannot eat while engaged in combat. However, certain abilities or special items may allow eating during specific
circumstances.

4. Food Quality :
   - Food quality affects recovery. Basic food items provide minimal restoration, while advanced meals can provide substantial buffs or heal 
significant portions of health or resources.

	Game Balance Considerations

1. Resource Management :
   - Scarcity of Higher-tier Food : Rare foods should be harder to obtain, ensuring they are valuable and used strategically, especially in 
challenging content.
   - Crafting and Gathering : Food items can be crafted by players with specific professions, adding a layer of complexity and value to gathering 
materials.

2. Strategic Use :
   - Players must manage when and what to eat based on their situationâ€”whether recovering quickly after a small skirmish or preparing for a tough 
battle.

	Future Considerations for Development

1. Food Combinations :
   - Multiple Buffs : Food could be designed to combine different buffs, making it a more strategic decision to pick the right meal based on the 
upcoming challenge.

2. Interaction with Other Mechanics :
   - Environmental Effects : The effectiveness of food may be affected by environmental factors (e.g., eating in extreme cold or hot zones could 
reduce the efficiency of recovery).

3. Food Quests :
   - Cooking and Gathering : Certain quests may require players to create special dishes or gather rare ingredients to complete, adding a role for 
professions like cooking or alchemy.
