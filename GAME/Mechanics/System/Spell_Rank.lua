			Spell_Rank
			
	Description : Each spell has ranks that reflect its potency. Higher-ranked spells are more effective, dealing more damage or having more 
significant debuffs. Some spells require the caster to level up or reach certain thresholds to access higher ranks.
	Additional Notes : Spells' ranks may also influence their casting time, area of effect, or resource consumption (e.g., mana or life force).
