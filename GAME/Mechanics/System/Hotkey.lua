			Hotkeys & Key Bindings

	Introduction : Hotkeys and Key Binding systems are designed to give players quicker access to crucial actions, character management, and system 
functionalities during gameplay. These systems work in tandem to improve responsiveness and enhance the overall gaming experience by allowing players 
to configure shortcuts for various commands, windows, and abilities.

		Hotkeys Mechanics

	Definition and Purpose : Hotkeys are customizable keyboard, mouse, or controller shortcuts assigned to specific in-game functions. These functions
can include targeting units, using abilities, activating items, and interacting with the game world. The goal is to streamline the user experience and
improve reaction times in combat or other time-sensitive situations.

	Types of Hotkeys :

1. Action Hotkeys  
   These hotkeys trigger combat abilities, spells, crafting actions, or other special features. For example:
   - F1, F2, F3, F4 : Assign combat abilities or spells to the function keys for quick access.
   - Number Keys (1-4) : Used for abilities or items in hotkey bars.
   - ALT + 1-4 : Used for additional skill hotkeys, allowing players to assign abilities to specific skill slots.

2. Targeting Hotkeys  
   Used to select a unit or target quickly, without needing to manually click on them. Examples include:
   - F1 : Set focus target to the currently selected enemy.
   - F2 : Switch between the main target and focus target.
   - Tab : Cycle through nearby enemies or NPCs.

3. Item Hotkeys  
   Allow players to quickly use consumables, key items, or tools.
   - Alt + 1-0 : Use specific items like potions, buffs, or teleportation items from the inventory.

4. Macro Hotkeys  
   Combine multiple actions into a single hotkey for efficiency. For example:
   - Shift + F1 : Activate a buff and immediately follow with a healing spell.
   - Ctrl + 1 : Cast a spell and use an item simultaneously.

		How to Edit Hotkeys

	Editing Hotkeys : Players can edit their hotkeys through the options menu in-game by navigating to the "Keyboard" section. This section allows 
players to view all current hotkey assignments, customize their key bindings, and set their preferred shortcuts. The hotkeys can be adjusted for quick
access to essential functions, providing players with more flexibility and control over their gameplay.

		Hotkeys & Key Binding Integration

	Dynamic Hotkey Use :  
- "Focus Target" hotkeys can be integrated into the system by assigning quick-switch buttons for focus (e.g., "F1, F2"). When a focus target is set, players can engage with the focus target immediately through their hotkey system.
- "Item Hotkeys" : Players can set "Hotkey bindings" for quick use of healing potions, buffs, or combat items, such as "CTRL + 1" for a health potion, or "ALT + 2" for a damage buff.

	Customization & Flexibility  
- Players have the option to customize their hotkeys and keybindings through the settings menu. This system allows full flexibility for players to 
adapt the controls to their preferences, providing optimal gameplay comfort.
- Keybindings for non-combat systems (such as opening windows or accessing maps) can be mapped to other easily accessible keys to maintain a smooth 
gameplay flow.

	Usage and System Limitations

1. "Cooldowns and Limits"  
   - Hotkeys linked to abilities or items may have cooldowns, preventing the same action from being triggered repeatedly in quick succession. Players 
must manage these cooldowns effectively to avoid overlapping actions.
   - Certain actions, like switching between focus targets or activating macros, may require a brief cooldown between uses.

2. "Interface and Feedback"  
   - Visual feedback on the user interface (UI) shows active abilities or items in the hotkey bar, providing cues to players regarding the state of 
their hotkeys and any cooldown timers.

3. "Global Hotkeys"  
   - These are essential commands that affect game-wide actions, such as toggling combat mode, switching between different UI windows, or activating 
abilities.
   - ESC Key : Can be bound as a universal key to open the main menu or perform emergency actions such as pausing or accessing in-game settings.
