			Spell_Casting_Time
			
	Description : Spells can be cast instantly or take time to channel. The casting time determines how long a caster must maintain focus to unleash 
the spell:
	- Instant Cast : Spells that take effect immediately after casting.
	- Channeled Spells : Spells that continue to affect the target over the duration of the casting time.
	Additional Notes : Spells can be interrupted by certain actions, such as "STUN" or specific conditions that disable casting.
