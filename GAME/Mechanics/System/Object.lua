			Object  

	Object Overview : Objects in "World Game" are elements within the in-game world represented by graphic models. They can be permanent or temporary 
and can appear in various forms, including fixed structures, lootable items, and mobile entities. Objects can serve multiple functions, from 
contributing to the environment to affecting gameplay.

	Types of Objects

1. "Landscape Objects"
   - Large, stationary objects such as towers, buildings, and city walls that become part of the environment and terrain.
   - These objects typically serve as background elements and are crucial to the game's world design.

2. "Fixed Device (Fixed Object)"
   - Objects that are neither mobile nor spawned. These devices typically serve a specific function.
   - Example: "Mailbox", a fixed object that can be interacted with to send or receive in-game mail.

3. "Spawned Object"
   - Objects that are generated or spawn in specific locations but are not mobile.
   - These objects can be static and may exist for specific purposes, such as quest items or environmental props.

4. "Mobile Object (Mob)"
   - These objects are spawned but can move within the environment. Often they are linked to NPCs or other moving entities.
   - Example: A treasure chest that moves periodically or a mobile NPC.

5. "Location Objects"
   - Objects used to delineate or mark the boundaries of a specific area or effect within the game world.
   - These objects can be landscape, fixed, or spawned items, sometimes mobile, that define a location for an event or effect 
(e.g., boundary markers for a quest or event area).

6. "Lootable Object"
   - An object that can be interacted with to loot items, usually generating an inventory item upon interaction.
   - Example: Loot chests, barrels, and dead enemies that drop loot when interacted with.

7. "NPC (Non-Player Character)"
   - A specific type of object that represents characters controlled by the game, typically using AI (Artificial Intelligence).
   - These objects are interactable and often serve various roles like quest givers, vendors, or enemies.

8. "PC (Player Character)"
   - A special object controlled by the player, distinguishing it from NPCs and mobs.
   - This type of object is designed to represent the player's in-game character, with unique properties and abilities determined by the player.

9. "Displayable Gear"
   - Items that are visually attached to a player character, modifying the character's graphic model.
   - These items are worn by the player and affect the appearance of the character in the game world (e.g., armor, weapons, and other gear).

10. "Active Spells and Enchantments"
   - Effects or abilities applied to objects, characters, or locations, which can alter how objects interact within the game world.
   - These may include temporary visual changes or buffs/debuffs that affect movement, health, and other attributes.

	Additional Notes

- "Terrain" is a feature of vast scope in the game world but is not typically classified as an object.
- Many objects can be interacted with in various ways: selected, targeted, or used by the player.
- Some objects, such as lootable items or quest-related objects, can be picked up and added to the player's inventory.
- An object can belong to more than one type, as the categories listed are property descriptors, not necessarily exclusive groups.
