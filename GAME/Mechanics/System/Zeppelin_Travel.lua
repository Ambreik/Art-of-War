	Details : The "Zeppelin Travel System" offers a unique and non-mount-based method of flight, allowing players to travel long distances across the 
world, specifically between "Middlean Islands' Capital City" and "Legrand Continent's Grosvenor Port". This system offers a scenic, albeit slower, 
method of travel that requires a ticket or quest completion to access.

	Rules and Limitations :
- Departure Points : Zeppelin travel is only available at specific ports, such as "Grosvenor Port" in the "Garland Region" of "Legrand", and 
"Middlean Islands' Capital City".
- Ticket Purchase : Players must purchase a "Zeppelin Ticket" to access the airship. The cost and availability of tickets may vary depending on the 
player's faction or current quests.
- Travel Time : Zeppelin travel takes a predetermined amount of time, offering players an opportunity for in-flight interaction, relaxation, and view 
of the world from above. Players cannot engage in combat or change course while aboard.
- Passenger Restrictions : Only players without **Flying Mounts** or **special abilities** to travel can utilize the Zeppelin system. Special NPCs may
be available for the role of the Zeppelin Operator, offering additional services or quests related to air travel.
- Arrival and Departure : When arriving at the destination, the Zeppelin will land at designated **Zeppelin Docks**. Players will disembark, ready to 
continue their journey, with limited time to board the Zeppelin before it departs.
