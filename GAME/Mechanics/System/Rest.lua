			Rest  

	Rest Overview : The Rest system allows players to accumulate a bonus modifier for experience points (XP) gained while rested. This bonus increases
the XP gained from monster kills and other eligible activities. The rest bonus gradually diminishes as it is used, and it is replenished over time 
when the character spends time in a tavern or engages in non-AFK activities.

	Key Features of Rest Bonus

1. "Rested XP Bonus"
	- Characters receive an increased XP rate when rested. The amount of bonus XP is displayed in the top side of the screen along with other active 
buffs.
	- Example: If a character gains 120 XP from a monster kill, the combat log may display:  
<System Message>: By killing "x monster name" you were granted 120 XP (+60 rested XP)`. This indicates that the character received 60 XP as the rested
bonus, which is 50% of the base XP.

2. "Rested XP Accumulation"
   - The rest bonus is gradually accumulated when the character is in a tavern or other resting locations. This process is slow and requires non-AFK 
activities to maintain the bonus.
   - Rest time is not unlimited. The bonus time decreases gradually to 0 as it is consumed by earned XP. 

3. "Purpose of the Rest Bonus"
   - "Encourages Breaks" : The rest bonus is designed to reward players who take breaks from constant grinding, promoting relaxation and engagement 
in other aspects of the game, such as trading or PvP.
   - "Boost for Casual Players" : Players who play less frequently or for shorter sessions benefit from a higher XP gain rate, making it easier to 
level up.
   - "Gameplay Balance" : The rest bonus encourages players to rest in taverns, helping avoid burnout and promoting a balanced gameplay experience. It
also helps alleviate the need for constant outdoor grinding.

4. "XP Bonus Details"
   - The rest bonus only applies to eligible XP sources such as monster kills. Experience from exploration and quests does not consume the rested 
bonus, providing players a way to gain XP without affecting their rest status.
   - The rest bonus can stack with other XP-boosting effects, such as "EXP Rings" or "Potions of Experience". 

5. "Rest Bonus Limitations"
   - Even when the rest bonus is constantly maintained, it represents only a small fraction of the overall XP needed for leveling. It is intended to 
be a helpful boost, not a requirement for progression.
   - Diminishing Returns : The bonus will gradually decrease over time until it is fully depleted, after which players will need to rest again to 
accumulate more bonus XP.
