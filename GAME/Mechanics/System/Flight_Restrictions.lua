	Rules :  
- No Combat While Flying : Players cannot engage in combat or interact with NPCs while flying. Combat must occur when on solid ground or within 
specific aerial combat zones.
- Flight Zones : Flying is only permitted in certain zones (such as Legrand or designated flying regions). In other areas like cities or dungeons, 
players will be unable to summon or use their Flying Mounts.
- Flight in Combat Zones : Some areas have air-based combat restrictions or specific aerial enemy NPCs that may challenge flying players.
- Dismounting : Players can dismount their flying mount manually or will be automatically dismounted if they enter an area where flying is not 
permitted.
