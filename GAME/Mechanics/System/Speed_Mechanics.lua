	Introduction : "Speed" in "World Game" encompasses two critical gameplay elements: "Weapon Speed" and "Movement Speed". These mechanics influence 
combat and exploration, creating a dynamic balance between player classes and ensuring strategic depth in gameplay.

	Section 1: Weapon Speed

	Core Concept :  
Weapon speed determines the delay between attacks, influencing the weapon's damage per second (DPS). Each weapon is classified based on:  
- Attack Damage Value : Physical damage dealt per strike.  
- Magical Damage Value : Magical damage dealt by specific weapons during skill use.  
- Attack Speed : Frequency of attacks, represented as the time between strikes.

	Class Weapon Assignments :  
1. "Warriors" :
	- Knights and Arahans : Swords with medium attack speed, balancing physical attack damage with reliable progression.  
	- Defenders and Paladins : Spears with the lowest attack speed but the highest Attack Damage Value.  
2. "Shamans" :  
	- Bells : Higher physical Attack Damage Value, used for basic hits.  
	- Fans : Higher Magical Damage Value, ideal for skill usage. Medium attack speed for both.  
3. "Warlocks" :  
	- Blades : High Attack Damage Value but lower Magical Damage Value.  
	- Scepters : Higher Magical Damage Value, suitable for skill-oriented playstyles. Medium attack speed.  
4. "Ninjas" :  
	- Assassin and Rogue : Daggers with high attack speed, focused on physical damage only.  
	- Archer and Ranger : Bows with medium attack speed but the highest Attack Damage Value.  
5. "Werewolves" :  
	- Claws with low attack speed and medium Attack Damage Value, emphasizing tanky close-range combat.  
6. "Vampires" :  
	- Blood Talons with medium attack speed and a balanced Attack Damage Value.  

	Upgrade Mechanics :  
Weapons are upgradable from +0 to +9, affecting:  
- Increased Attack Damage or Magical Damage values.  
- Slightly improved attack speed, reducing the delay between attacks.

	Section 2: Movement Speed

	Core Concept :  
Movement speed refers to the rate at which a character or mob traverses the game world. This attribute is affected by the character's class, equipment, and inventory weight, ensuring strategic depth in both PvE and PvP settings.  

	Base Speed by Class :  
1. Agile Classes :  
	- Vampires, Ninjas: Higher base movement speed for better maneuverability in combat.  
2. Tanky Classes :  
	- Werewolves, Paladins and Defender: Lower base movement speed, reflecting their focus on durability and defense.  

	Modifiers :  
1. Equipment Weight :  
	- Heavy armors (e.g., "Plate Armor") decrease movement speed proportionally to their upgrade level.  
	- Agile characters gain more flexibility with lighter armor types.  
2. Inventory Load :  
	- Increased inventory weight reduces movement speed.  
	- Promotes thoughtful inventory management for optimal performance.  
3. Environmental Effects (Optional):  
	- Terrain (e.g., mud, snow) may modify base movement speed temporarily.
