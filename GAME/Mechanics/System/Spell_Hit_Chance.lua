			Spell_Hit_Chance
			
	Description : Spells have a hit chance, which determines the likelihood that a spell will successfully land on a target. Various factors influence
this, including the caster's level, the target's resistance, and any buffs or debuffs in play. Certain spells may also have a chance to miss, 
especially if interrupted.
