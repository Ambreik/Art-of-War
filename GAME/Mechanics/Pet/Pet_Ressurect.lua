			Pet_Ressurect

	Introduction : Pets, as loyal companions in the game, may occasionally be downed or "killed" in combat. Resurrection mechanics for pets allow 
players to bring their pets back to life in a way that feels immersive and requires effort and resources. While players can summon and revive their 
pets, there are certain conditions and cooldowns tied to resurrection abilities.

	Resurrection Process
- "Self-Resurrection" (Pet) : Some pets may have the ability to resurrect themselves automatically after a certain time frame or under certain 
conditions, such as when they die in combat. This feature can be triggered through a specific pet ability or item.
- Player-Activated Resurrection : Players can choose to resurrect their pet manually through a resurrection item or spell. The process may require specific resources (like Pet Revival Potions or special Rune Stones), which can be crafted or obtained through quests or vendors.

	Resurrection Costs
- XP Deduction : Some pets might have an XP cost for resurrection, which varies depending on their level or the circumstances under which they were 
killed.
- Items : Certain resurrection items like Pet Revival Stones or specific consumables are needed to bring the pet back to life. These items may be 
crafted, looted, or purchased from NPCs.
- Gold : Some resurrection processes may involve a gold cost, especially if it is linked to a vendor NPC that offers resurrection services.

	Resurrection Time
- Instant Resurrect : Some pets may be revived instantly through specific abilities or items. This can be used during combat for strategic purposes.
- Cooldown Timer : Resurrection through player abilities or items often requires a cooldown timer. This ensures that players cannot resurrect pets too
frequently and must plan their actions.
- Resurrection Delay : Certain conditions, such as death in hostile areas or in specific zones, may result in a longer resurrection time. The delay 
might range from 5-60 seconds, depending on where the resurrection is taking place.

	Post-Resurrection Effects
- Stat Penalties : After a pet is resurrected, it may temporarily suffer from reduced stats (e.g., lower damage, defense, or health), which gradually 
return to normal over time.
- Fatigue : Some pets may experience fatigue post-resurrection, reducing their effectiveness for a short period. This could be in the form of slower 
movement speed, reduced attack speed, or lower defense.
