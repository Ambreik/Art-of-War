	Overview : Several items can help players breathe underwater, each offering different durations and effects:  

- "Drowning Potion" :  
  - Effect : When consumed, the player gains the ability to breathe underwater slowly. However, they lose the ability to perform skills or summon 
mounts while underwater.  
  - Note : If a mount is already summoned, it will not be affected, but the player cannot summon a mount underwater.  

- "Elixir of Water Breathing" :  
  - Effect : This "Alchemy-crafted elixir" grants the player the ability to breathe underwater for 1 hour. The effect cannot be deactivated, and the
player cannot summon mounts or pets while the elixir is active.  

- "Mystic Fishing Enchantment" :  
  - Effect : An enchantment applied to a "Fishing Rod" that allows the player to breathe underwater, but only in lakes, deep rivers, or water pools. 
This enchantment is specifically useful for fishing in these locations.
