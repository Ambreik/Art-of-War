- Water-based Monsters : Certain monsters are specialized for aquatic combat and may be faster in the water. Their attack patterns might change based 
on the water's depth, such as launching ranged attacks from underwater or ambushing players when they swim too close.

- Bosses and Notorious Monsters : Powerful monsters like World Bosses or Notorious Monsters may have unique swim-related abilities, such as summoning 
water currents to impede player movement or using spells that only affect characters in the water.
