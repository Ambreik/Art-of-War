			Monster_Stun_Lock
			
	Description : High-level monsters, such as "World Bosses" and "Notorious Monsters", are capable of creating stun locks as part of their more 
advanced and challenging attack patterns. These creatures may combine multiple forms of stuns, including group-wide stuns, targeted stuns, and AoE 
stuns.
	Abilities Affected :  
*Powerful monsters can use specific abilities like "Roar of the Deep" or "Shadow Strike" that apply stuns to players within a certain radius or line 
of sight.
	Strategic Importance :  
*Players facing monsters that utilize stun lock mechanics must be especially careful, as they often have a high resistance to stuns themselves and may
only be vulnerable to a particular type of counter-effect, such as certain debuff removals or abilities.
	World Bosses & Notorious Monsters :  
*World Bosses and Notorious Monsters are designed with stun lock mechanics to challenge even high-level players. Players must coordinate with their 
team to manage stuns, using abilities or consumables to break the stun lock or mitigate damage.
