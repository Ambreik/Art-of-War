	Description : This section covers how monsters use spells. Monster spells include offensive and defensive abilities based on their type and rank. 
They can deal damage, apply debuffs, or even heal allies. Monster spells can have varying casting times, and some may require specific conditions 
(e.g., a boss monster requiring a corpse to cast a powerful spell).
