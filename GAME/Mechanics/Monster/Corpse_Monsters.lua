	Description : "Monster Corpses" are the remains of hostile creatures that players defeat in combat. These corpses may have unique mechanics, 
lootable resources, and interactions defined by the specific type of monster.

- Decay Time : Monster corpses typically decay within 5 seconds, but this duration can be influenced by environmental factors, monster rarity, or quest involvement.  
- Lootable Corpses : Some monster corpses can be looted for materials, such as rare crafting components or quest-related items. These interactions are more likely with specific types of monsters.  
- Skinning and Harvesting : Monsters such as beasts, undead, or certain humanoids can be skinned or harvested for resources (e.g., leather, bones, or herbs). After the player loots or skins the corpse, it disappears.  
- Refer to Monster Mechanics : For more specific mechanics about monster corpses, such as spawn rates, loot tables, and specific types of harvestable resources.
