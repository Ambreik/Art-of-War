			Panic Mode

	1. Introduction

* Panic Mode is a defensive or survival-oriented behavior used by monsters when combat conditions trigger extreme stress (e.g., leader death, group collapse, HP threshold).
* Adds unpredictability to encounters, especially with monster groups.

	2. Triggers

* Leader Death : Minions enter panic when their leader falls.
* HP Threshold : Monster panics below a certain HP % (commonly 20–30%).
* Overwhelming Threat : Panic can occur if surrounded or outnumbered.

	3. Effects

* Flight Behavior : Monster flees toward safe zones or nearby reinforcements.
* Erratic Movement : Reduces accuracy, increases dodge chance, but lowers defense.
* Surrender State (optional) : Some weaker monsters might stop fighting and cower.

	4. Group Dynamics

* Panic may spread to nearby allies, creating chain reactions.
* Higher-rank monsters (III–V) have resistance to panic, making them more reliable.

	5. Counterplay

* Players can use crowd control to prevent escape.
* Panic can create opportunities for ambush or pursuit mechanics.
