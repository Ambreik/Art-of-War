			Sitting_Mechanics

	Mechanics :  
1. Activating Sit :  
	- Players can press a designated key (e.g., "X") to sit, or select "Sit" from the action menu.  
	- Some interactable objects (benches or chairs) can be right-clicked to prompt characters to sit appropriately.  

2. Restrictions While Sitting :  
	- Characters cannot engage in auto-attacks or use most combat-related skills while seated.  
	- Sitting stops auto-attacks but does not interrupt ongoing spell-casting.  
	- Movement (jumping, walking, or running) cancels the sit state, transitioning the character to standing.  

3. Interaction with Items :  
	- Eating food or drinking (except potions) requires the character to sit. If not already seated, the character will automatically attempt to sit 
when initiating these actions.  

4. Regeneration Bonus :  
	- Natural health and mana regeneration rates are increased when sitting.
