	Effects of Being Drunk :  
1. Visual Impairments :  
   - Increased blurriness around screen edges, intensifying with inebriation.
   - Random directional shifts during movement (walking, running, flying, or swimming).  
   - Dangerous flight mechanics: unexpected ascents or dives.  
   - Risk of drowning while swimming, as forward movement tends to angle downward.

2. Combat Impairments :  
   - Illusory Enemy Levels : NPC or PvP opponents appear up to 7 levels lower than their actual level.
   - Combat difficulty remains unchanged, despite level illusions.  
   - Increased vulnerability: +10% susceptibility to crowd control (CC).  

3. Random Effects :  
   - Drunken Vomit : A spell triggered by extreme intoxication, causing vomiting, a brief stun, and movement pause.  
   - Movement penalties: characters may veer or stumble unpredictably, making precise control difficult.

4. PvP Interactions :  
   - Opponents appear at lower levels, but gameplay mechanics (reaction time, casting speed) remain unaffected.  
   - Drunken movement patterns could reveal a player's intoxicated state to observers.
