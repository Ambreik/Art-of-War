	- Momentum : While airborne, a character's momentum remains unchanged, and effects like "rooting" or "slow effects" will not alter the fall 
path unless affected by a forced movement spell.  
	- Strategic Jumping : To counter movement-altering effects (e.g., roots or slows), players should aim their jump toward the target for extra 
distance before the effect takes full hold.
