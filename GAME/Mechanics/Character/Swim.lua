			Swim
			
	Description : Swimming mechanics govern the player's ability to move through water. When in water, characters can enter swimming mode and 
navigate in a way that differs from regular movement. Players and NPCs can interact with aquatic environments, using unique controls to move in all 
directions in the water.

	Mechanics :

- Swim Movement : When a character enters the water, they automatically switch to swim mode. The player can move forward, backward, and turn in the 
water, using special controls designed for fluid movement.
  
- Mouse Control : 
    - Right Mouse Button : Holding the right mouse button will allow the player to look around while in the water.
    - Left Mouse Button : Holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse up and down will control the direction of swimming. Moving the mouse 
forward or backward will make the character swim in the respective direction.
  
- Swimming Speed : Characters move slower in water than on land, but the swimming speed is affected by the character's stamina and equipment 
(e.g., diving gear, magic buffs).

- Stamina Consumption : Swimming will consume stamina, and the longer a character stays in the water, the more stamina they will lose. If stamina runs
out, the character may drown if they remain underwater.

- Surface Interaction : If a character swims towards the surface, they can jump out of the water (if they are close enough), transitioning back to 
normal standing or running movement. The time it takes to perform this action depends on the character's swimming skill.

- Diving : Some characters may be able to dive underwater, depending on their abilities, skill level, or specific items. Diving enables access to 
underwater areas or treasure hunting.
