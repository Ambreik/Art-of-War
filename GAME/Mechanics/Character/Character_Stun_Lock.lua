			Character_Stun_Lock

	Description : Stun Lock in characters occurs when a sequence of stun abilities or effects are applied by an enemy, preventing the player from 
moving, attacking, or using abilities for a limited period.  
	Abilities Affected :  
*Stuns, including both temporary and persistent stuns, can be used in PvP (Player vs. Player) or PvE (Player vs. Environment) combat. Players may have
resistance or immunity to certain stuns based on class abilities, gear, or buffs.
	Breaking the Stun Lock :  
*Players can break out of a stun lock with certain abilities, items, or effects that provide stun immunity, such as trinkets, potions, or class
abilities like "Break Free." Stun locks are generally limited by a cooldown mechanic to prevent overuse.
	Duration & Interactions :  
*Stun lock duration is governed by the cumulative time of each individual stun effect. However, some stuns may stack (extend the duration), while 
others may reset the stun lock timer.
