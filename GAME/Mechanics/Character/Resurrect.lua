			Resurrect

	"Resurrect" refers to the mechanic in which a player or NPC is brought back to life after dying. This can happen through various methods, whether by
player action or magic, and is essential for continuing a character's journey after death.

	Resurrection Methods:
1. Self-Resurrection : 
	- Players can choose from different resurrection locations and methods:
		- "Resurrect Here" : Available in certain outdoor situations, allowing the player to return to the location they died.
		- "Resurrect in Town" : Can be used both indoors and outdoors, teleporting the player to the nearest settlement 
(village, town, main city, tavern, portal).
		- "Resurrect in Graveyard" : Requires a special item ("Immortality from Underworld") and can only be used in the "Underworld Realm."

2. Magic Resurrection : 
   - Certain magic users, like "Shaman Healers" and "Warlock Sorcerers", can use resurrection spells to bring fallen players back to life in combat. 
This resurrection method involves a temporary penalty to the character's stats:
		- Stat Reduction : Resurrected characters have 10% lower stats, 15% reduced equipment durability, and 30% reduced HP regeneration.

	Resurrection Mechanics:
1. Resurrection Timer : 
	- "Resurrect Here" : Requires a 5-second wait after the first death, but this wait increases up to 10 seconds if the player dies again within the 
next 150 seconds.
	- "Resurrect in Town" : Involves a 30-second wait before being teleported back to a town or settlement.
	- "Resurrect in Graveyard" : A 60-second wait is required, and the player must have activated the "Immortality from Underworld" item before death.

2. Experience Loss :
   - Every resurrection costs the character some experience points, with a higher cost if the player dies repeatedly in a short time. 
   - Players with 0 XP gained do not lose any experience points upon resurrection.

	Special Notes:
- The "Shaman Healer" and "Warlock Sorcerer" are the primary classes with access to resurrection magic.
- Resurrection is governed by specific conditions, such as the death needing to have occurred within 5 seconds and the character not already having 
chosen the "Resurrect in Town" option.
