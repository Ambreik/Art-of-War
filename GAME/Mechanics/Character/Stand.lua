			Stand

	Description: The "Stand" mechanic refers to the character's upright position, typically used in preparation for combat or exploration. Unlike a 
sitting position, standing allows the character to move freely and engage in most in-game activities.

	Sections:

	1. Stand Mechanics Overview  
- "Stand" represents the default, neutral position of a character while not engaged in combat.
- The standing position enables characters to walk, run, jump, and initiate combat directly.  
- A character begins in this position and automatically assumes it when transitioning from sitting.  
- The transition between standing and sitting positions takes a brief moment, but switching from "Stand" to any movement (walking, running, etc.) or 
action like combat does not require any significant time.

	2. Stand Transitions  
- Sit to Stand Transition : When a character is sitting, they need a short amount of time to stand up.  
- Stand to Sit Transition : It takes about the same time to sit from standing, preventing sudden movement or actions during this transition.  
- Movement from Stand : Actions such as walking, running, and combat can immediately begin from the standing position with no additional delay.

	3. Stand-Related Mechanics  
- Stand and Combat : Standing is the primary position for characters to engage in combat. Many classes, skills, and spells rely on the character being
in a standing posture to function.
- Automatic Transition : If a character is sitting, any action (like walking, jumping, or attacking) will automatically transition them into the 
standing position.

	Additional Notes:
- Action Speed : The transition times between sitting and standing are short, ensuring that players don't face delays when shifting positions.  
- Combat Readiness : Characters are always ready to engage in combat while standing.  
- Behavior in Combat : The standing position may have different stances based on the character's class, race, or status (e.g., defensive or 
aggressive stances for certain classes).
