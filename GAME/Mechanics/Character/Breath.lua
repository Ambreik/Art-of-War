	Description : Breath is a core mechanic in "World Game" that governs how the player interacts with underwater environments. When the player swims 
or dives beneath the surface, their "Breath meter" begins to deplete. This blue meter lasts for 3 minutes, after which the player starts taking health
damage and eventually drowns if they fail to resurface. Players must manage their breath by returning to the surface or utilizing various mechanics to
delay or prevent drowning.

Usage :  
- Breath Meter :  
  The "Breath meter" is a blue bar displayed on the screen, which counts down the amount of time the player can stay underwater. The default duration 
is 3 minutes.
  
  - If the meter depletes completely, the character begins to take substantial damage every second.  
  - If not replenished by resurfacing or utilizing special mechanics, the player will drown and die.  
  - PvP Use : Underwater combat can be used strategically to stun or root enemies, forcing them to drown if they cannot recover their breath.

- Breath Recovery :  
  Players must resurface to refill the Breath meter. The player can also interact with specific objects, such as air pockets or water breathing items,
to replenish their breath.  
  "Air pockets" include bubbles from underwater fissures or giant clams in the "Great Sea".
