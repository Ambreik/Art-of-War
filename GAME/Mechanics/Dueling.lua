	1. Overview  
**File Name : Dueling  
**Folder : System  

	Description : Dueling allows players in the PvE environment to engage in consensual one-on-one combat. Players from opposing factions may duel, 
but it is primarily intended for dueling players of the same faction. Duels serve as a way to test skills, challenge friends, or practice without 
rewards beyond the thrill of victory.

	2. Dueling Mechanics  
**File Name : Dueling_Mechanics  
**Folder : Combat Mechanics  

	Mechanics :  
1. Initiating a Duel :  
   - Right-click on a player's portrait and select "Duel."  
   - A Duel flag will drop from the sky, and the opponent must accept for the duel to begin. A countdown will show the time remaining before the duel starts.  
   - Alternatively, use the command `/duel` while targeting the opponent. This is useful for creating macros for dueling.  

2. Dueling Restrictions :  
   - Dueling is disabled in most capital cities and dungeons.  
   - Attempting to duel in these areas triggers an on-screen notification: "Dueling isn't allowed here."  
   - Exception : The Underworld Realm allows dueling.

	3. Dueling Etiquette  
File Name : Dueling_Etiquette  
Folder : Character  

	Etiquette Guidelines :  
1. Bad Etiquette :  
   - Requesting to duel much lower-level players.  
   - Using potions or allies to buff before a duel.  
   - Running behind obstacles to buy time.  
   - Repeatedly requesting duels after losing (or winning).  
   - Challenging players who are occupied with other tasks (e.g., crafting, fighting mobs).  

2. Good Etiquette :  
   - Requesting a duel after getting the other player's consent.  
   - Letting opponents buff up before starting.  
   - Healing defeated opponents and offering praise when losing.  
   - Offering positive emotes or helping the opponent when theyâ€™re attacked by mobs after losing.

	4. Duel Conclusion  
**File Name : Duel_Conclusion  
**Folder : Combat Mechanics  

	Ending a Duel :  
1. **Victory Conditions :  
   - A duel ends when one player reaches one hit point, signaling their defeat. The system announces: "<winning_player_name> has defeated <losing_player_name> in a duel."  
   - Players can sometimes die after the duel ends, especially if there are delayed damage effects, like a Warlock's DoT (damage over time) spells.  
   
2. **Fleeing :  
   - A duel ends if a player moves too far away from the Duel Flag. The system will announce: "<fleeing_player_name> has fled a duel with <remaining_player_name>."  
   - Players can forfeit a duel by typing `/forfeit` or `/yield`.

	5. Rewards and Consequences  
**File Name : Duel_Rewards  
**Folder : System  

	Outcomes :  
- Victory : Winning a duel grants the player RP (Roleplay points). No XP or Honor is awarded, and there is no loot from the opponent. The satisfaction of defeating another player is the primary reward.  
- Wagering : Players may choose to place bets, which may result in gaining or losing gold.  
- Achievements : First-time duel winners unlock the **Duel-icious** achievement.

	6. Special Notes  
**File Name : Duel_Notes  
**Folder : System  

	Additional Information :  
- Dueling in neutral towns or cities can provoke NPC guards, potentially leading to an attack and reputation loss for the duelers.  
- Players on the "ignore" list cannot be dueled.  
- You are considered "in combat" for the duration of the duel, even if the opponent is defeated.  
- Players under level 20 cannot be dueled, and they cannot be targeted in PvP situations.

This structure should now match the format we've previously established. If this looks good to you, I can continue to work with this structure for future tasks.
