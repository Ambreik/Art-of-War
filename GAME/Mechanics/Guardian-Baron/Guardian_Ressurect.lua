			Guardian_Ressurect

	Introduction : Guardians are powerful entities entrusted with protecting key players or locations. Their resurrection process is tied to both 
their combat abilities and their role as protectors. Like Barons, Guardians require more resources and specific items to be resurrected compared to 
standard NPCs or pets.

	Resurrection Process
- "Self-Resurrection" (Guardian) : Some Guardians may have an inherent ability to self-resurrect within a short time frame after death, though this 
may be restricted by certain gameplay conditions (e.g., death in specific zones).
- Player-Activated Resurrection : To resurrect a Guardian, players may need to use specialized items or abilities. These items could include Guardian 
Sigils, special Revival Potions, or ancient relics that hold the Guardian’s soul. Players might also need to activate a special altar or shrine tied 
to the Guardian’s powers.

	Resurrection Costs
- XP Penalty : Resurrection of a Guardian often involves a significant XP loss, either from the player or the Guardian, depending on the resurrection 
method.
- Special Items : Guardians may require unique items for their resurrection, such as Guardian Relics or Soul Crystals, which are generally hard to 
acquire and might require special quests or events.
- Resource and Gold Costs : High costs in terms of gold, materials, and resources could be involved in a Guardian’s resurrection. This ensures that 
resurrecting a Guardian is a deliberate action requiring significant investment.

	Resurrection Time
- "Instantaneous Resurrection" : Certain powerful resurrection methods, like those tied to high-tier magical items or abilities, may allow Guardians 
to be brought back instantly.
- Cooldown Timer : If a resurrection involves a cooldown, it may take anywhere from 5 seconds to several minutes for the Guardian to be revived, 
depending on the method used.
  
	Post-Resurrection Effects
- Health and Power Reduction : After resurrection, Guardians may experience a temporary drop in their health or power, which regenerates over time as 
they regain their strength.
- Battle Fatigue : Guardians may need a brief recovery period after resurrection, making them weaker or slower to act initially. This is a common 
mechanic to balance their powerful abilities.
