			Sit
			
	Description : The "Sit" action is a non-combat mechanic that allows characters to assume a resting position, either crouching on the ground or 
sitting on an interactable object like a bench or chair. Sitting enhances regeneration, facilitates food and drink consumption, and acts as a role-
playing tool. However, it restricts combat capabilities and interaction with most skills or items. Characters transition from sitting to standing 
automatically when required for actions like jumping, walking, or running.
