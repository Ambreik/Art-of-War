		Fall_Etiquette

	Guidelines :  
- Exploration Caution : When exploring, players should always consider the height of jumps and falls, especially when navigating through high areas 
such as cliffs, towers, or rooftops. Always be mindful of your surroundings and plan your movements carefully.
- Combat Awareness : If engaged in battle, avoid falling into dangerous areas that could cause additional harm (e.g., lava pits, spikes, or environmental hazards). Always consider your environment to avoid falling into disadvantageous positions.
- Environmental Awareness : Before attempting to jump down from high places, assess the landing area for potential hazards, such as water, enemies, or
environmental traps that could hinder recovery.
