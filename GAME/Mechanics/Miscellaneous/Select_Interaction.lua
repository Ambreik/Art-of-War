	Interaction Mechanics :  
- "Right-clicking" on a selected target can initiate several interactions:
	- Friendly NPCs : Opens a dialog window where players can interact, buy goods, or accept quests.  
	- Hostile NPCs and Mobs : Right-clicking generally triggers the auto-attack system and begins combat.  
	- Non-combatant NPCs : Depending on the NPCâ€™s role, right-clicking may allow trading, whispering, inspecting, or dueling options.  
	- Mounts and Pets : Right-clicking on a mount or pet (if not in combat) may provide options such as mounting, dismounting, or interacting with 
pet-specific abilities.
