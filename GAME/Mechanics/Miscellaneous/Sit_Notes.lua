			Sit_Notes

	Additional Information :  
1. Combat Interruption :  
   - Sitting in combat significantly increases vulnerability, as it disables movement and most combat skills. Players should avoid sitting during 
active combat scenarios.  

2. Interactable Seating :  
   - Not all benches, chairs, or stools are interactable. Players can identify interactable objects by hovering the cursor over them or receiving 
prompts.  

3. Automatic Standing :  
   - Certain actions, like initiating combat, force the character to stand even if seated.  

4. Recovery Interaction :  
   - Sitting near specific objects or in safe zones (e.g., around campfires) may further boost regeneration or provide temporary buffs.
