	Additional Information :  
- Group and Raid Targeting : In group or raid settings, players can set specific targets for their party members, including healing or buffing 
specific individuals.  
- Selecting Objects and Structures : Some game structures (e.g., chests, doors, levers) can be selected but not interacted with in the same manner as 
NPCs. These objects will have a unique cursor icon when hovered.  
- NPC Targeting : When targeting NPCs for quests or dialogue, right-clicking or selecting them can trigger scripted events, such as quests starting or
items being sold.
