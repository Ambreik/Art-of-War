			Use_Special_Notes  

	Additional Information :  
- Some "Use" actions are not bound to items but instead to specific environmental interactions, like activating mechanisms in dungeons or interacting 
with world events (e.g., pushing a boulder to block a path or activating a device that triggers a world event).
- The mechanic can be extended or modified based on the game's design, adding complexity like crafting systems or advanced spell casting where the 
use of an item may affect multiple aspects of gameplay simultaneously.
