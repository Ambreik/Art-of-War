			Fall_Special_Notes

	Additional Information :  
- Fall-based Quests : Some quests may involve jumping or falling from great heights. For example, players might need to jump from a tower or cliff to 
reach a hidden area or to trigger an event.
- Environmental Interactions : Certain weather conditions, such as heavy winds or storms, may exacerbate the risks associated with falling, causing 
players to fall faster or in unintended directions. Players should be cautious during these weather events.
- Diving or High-Speed Descents : In certain areas, players may perform a "Dive" or "Drop Attack", where falling can be used as a combat advantage
or to reach hard-to-reach areas.
