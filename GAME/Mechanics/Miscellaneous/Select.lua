	Description : The "Select" function allows players to target a unit in the game, which is crucial for interacting with NPCs, mobs, and other 
players. Selecting is the action of identifying a target, either for combat, interaction, or any game mechanic that requires targeting. This can be 
done by directly clicking on a target or using key bindings to cycle through available options. The system also includes automatic AI behavior for 
targeting, ensuring that the game environment remains dynamic.
