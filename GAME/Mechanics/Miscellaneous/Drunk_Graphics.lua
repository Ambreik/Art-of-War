	Blurry Visuals : Supported graphics cards simulate inebriation with a blurring effect around the edges of the screen. This intensifies as the player becomes more intoxicated, creating a realistic yet challenging visual experience.

- Disabling Effects : Players who wish to disable visual blurring can use the following in-game command:  
  - `"/console ffxGlow 0"` (Disable).  
  - `"/console ffxGlow 1"` (Enable).
