				Vashthara Mechanics

1. Pressure and Depth Mechanics : 
	- Mechanic : As players dive deeper into "Vashthara", the pressure increases, affecting their health and stamina regeneration. In certain areas, players need 
specific equipment (Pressure-Resistant Armor) or potions to withstand the pressure.
	- Gameplay Impact : This mechanic requires players to prepare before descending too deep, introducing a sense of gradual progression. Upgrading pressure gear or
finding rare pressure-resistant potions allows them to explore further, slowly revealing more dangerous areas and hidden treasures.
	
	Mechanics Overview : 
	
	Pressure Levels : 
- As players dive deeper, they encounter increasing pressure, which can affect their movement speed, health regeneration, and ability to cast spells or use items.
- Players must manage their depth to avoid penalties. For example, at shallow depths, players may experience minimal effects, but at greater depths, they could face
significant movement debuffs or health loss.

	Pressure Effects :
- Physical Debuffs : As pressure increases, players may suffer from effects such as reduced stamina, slower swimming speed, or impaired vision.
- Health Effects : Prolonged exposure to high pressure may cause players to lose health over time or develop a condition akin to decompression sickness, requiring 
them to ascend to shallower waters to recover.
- Environmental Interaction : Certain underwater areas may be accessible only to players with specialized gear or potions that mitigate the effects of pressure.

	Rescue Mechanic :
- Players could encounter "Rescue Stations" at various depths where they can temporarily regain health and stamina or find equipment that allows them to dive deeper
safely.

	Depth-based Quests :
- Certain quests may only trigger at specific depths, encouraging exploration and strategic planning when choosing how deep to venture.

		Equipment and Potions List :

	To aid players in navigating the challenges posed by pressure and depth, a variety of equipment and potions can be introduced:
	
	Equipment :
"Pressure Suit" : Specially designed armor that protects against pressure effects, allowing deeper dives without penalties.
"Depth-Adjusting Gear" : Adjustable equipment that can help players manage pressure levels; for example, it could provide a buoyancy effect that allows for easier
ascents and descents.
"Oxygen Tanks" : Canisters that extend the time players can stay at depth without suffering health penalties.
"Underwater Visor" : Enhances vision under high-pressure conditions, allowing players to see better in dark waters or murky environments.
"Rebreather Mask" : Filters and recycles air, enabling longer dives and reducing oxygen consumption at depth.

	Potions : 
"Potion of Pressure Resistance" : Grants temporary immunity to pressure effects, allowing players to explore deeper areas without penalty.
"Healing Tonic" : A potion that restores health over time, particularly useful for recovering from pressure-related health loss.
"Elixir of Aquatic Adaptation" : Enhances swimming speed and maneuverability, making it easier to navigate in deep waters.
"Clarity Potion" : Improves underwater visibility for a limited time, negating the impairing effects of pressure on sight.
"Stamina Elixir" : Boosts stamina recovery while submerged, allowing players to maintain their activities longer in deeper waters.

2. Naga Influence Meter : 
   -  Mechanic : "The Naga Influence Meter" tracks the player’s alert level within "Vashthara". If the meter fills, players are marked as intruders, triggering 
increased enemy spawns, ambushes, and trap activations in nearby areas.
   - Gameplay Impact :  Moving through "Vashthara" requires stealth or swift execution of objectives, as an increased "Naga Influence level" causes elite patrols
and traps to be set. Reducing the meter involves taking out patrols quietly, avoiding specific high-alert zones, or using cloaking spells/items.

3. Underwater Navigation and Currents :
	- Mechanic : Strong ocean currents influence movement, pulling players into specific pathways, dangerous zones, or hidden areas. Players must learn how to ride 
or resist these currents using special movement skills (like Aqua Propulsion Boots) to reach secluded spots and avoid hazards.
	- Gameplay Impact : This dynamic forces players to carefully plan their paths or make quick adjustments. Certain currents might lead to exclusive zones or 
shortcuts, rewarding players who master navigation. Additionally, combat positioning is affected, making fights more challenging as players are shifted by the 
water’s force.

		Underwater Navigation and Currents

	Navigating underwater realms presents unique challenges and opportunities for exploration. In the "World Game", underwater navigation can be enhanced through 
the following mechanics:

	Currents : 
"Dynamic Currents" : Introduce varying underwater currents that affect movement speed and direction. Players can use these currents strategically to travel 
quickly across vast distances or evade enemies.
"Current Puzzles" : Players may need to solve puzzles involving manipulating currents to open pathways or access hidden areas. For instance, they might need to 
position underwater obstacles to redirect a current, allowing access to a new section of the realm.

	Navigation Tools : 
"Underwater Map" : Players can acquire special maps that highlight currents, hidden treasures, and significant landmarks, aiding in navigation.
"Sonar Devices" : Implement tools that allow players to detect nearby currents or objects.These devices could function similarly to sonar technology in real life,
providing a mini-map or radar effect that reveals hidden paths or dangers. end

	Environmental Indicators :
- Players can learn to read environmental cues, such as the behavior of aquatic life or the movement of debris, to predict current patterns and navigate more
effectively.

		Aqua Propulsion Boots

	To enhance mobility and navigation underwater, introducing "Aqua Propulsion Boots" can greatly impact gameplay. Here’s how they could function:

	1. Enhanced Speed : The boots provide a significant boost in swimming speed, allowing players to traverse larger distances quickly. This speed could be further 
enhanced by timing movements with currents, creating a synergistic effect.
	2. Burst Propulsion : Players can activate a burst mode that propels them forward rapidly for a short duration. This ability could be useful for escaping danger
or reaching distant objectives quickly. The burst could have a cooldown period to maintain balance and prevent overuse.
	3. Control Over Currents : The boots could allow players to navigate against strong currents, giving them the ability to explore areas that would typically be 
challenging to access. This feature encourages players to explore more and venture into deeper or riskier areas of the underwater realm.
	4. Visual Indicators : The "Aqua Propulsion Boots" could feature visual indicators (like glowing lights) that change color based on the surrounding current 
conditions, helping players understand their environment better. end

4. Bioluminescent Light and Limited Visibility : 
	-  Mechanic : Visibility in the "Underwater Realm" depends on bioluminescent plants and creatures. Certain paths, treasures, or enemies are only revealed when 
players activate or follow these light sources. Players can also carry light-emitting items, but these items may attract hostile "Naga".
	-  Gameplay Impact : This mechanic adds a layer of tension, where players have to balance the need to see against the risk of drawing attention.In darker zones,
teamwork is crucial as players need to manage light sources together, while enemies lurking in the shadows add danger and unpredictability.

		Bioluminescent Creatures : 
		
	The environment can be filled with bioluminescent plants and animals, creating a natural lighting effect that guides players through the underwater terrain. 
Players can interact with these elements, possibly using them to illuminate areas or unlock new paths.

		Limited Visibility :
	
	Players face challenges due to limited visibility, which can be exacerbated by environmental factors such as murky waters or debris. This creates an atmosphere 
of suspense and exploration, encouraging players to rely on light sources to illuminate their surroundings.
	Visibility can be affected by the depth of the water, requiring players to carefully navigate deeper areas while managing their light resources.

			Light-Emitting Items : 
	
	Glowing Coral Fragment : 
	- Description : A small fragment of coral that emits a soft blue-green glow.

small area. Players can collect these fragments in various underwater locations.

	Bioluminescent Lantern : 
	- Description : A lantern filled with bioluminescent algae that glows intensely.
	- Mechanic : This item has a limited duration (e.g., 30 minutes of glow time). Players can set it down or carry it, providing a larger radius of light 
(15 meters) and enhancing visibility during exploration. After its glow duration, it requires a cooldown period before it can be reactivated.

	Abyssal Lightstone :
	- Description : A mystical stone that pulses with a radiant light, rumored to be infused with the essence of Horras.
	- Mechanic : When used, it creates a large area of illumination (20 meters) and reveals hidden treasures or pathways. However, it can attract the attention of
underwater creatures, increasing the risk of ambushes. It has a single-use activation with a long cooldown period.

	Radiant Conch Shell :
	- Description : A conch shell that emits a bright light when blown into, much like a horn.
	- Mechanic : Players can blow into the shell to create a burst of light, illuminating the surrounding area for a short time (5 seconds). This item can be used 
strategically to navigate or disorient nearby enemies, providing a tactical advantage.

	Illuminating Potion : 
	- Description : A potion that, when consumed, grants the player temporary bioluminescence.
	- Mechanic : After consumption, the player glows brightly for a duration of 1 minute, illuminating a wide area and making it easier to explore dark corners of
the underwater realm. However, this glow can also make players more visible to enemies.

5. Environmental Hazard Zones : 
	- Mechanic : Certain areas in "Vashthara" are home to hazardous sea plants, thermal vents, or venomous coral formations. These hazards may inflict continuous
damage, slow movement, or apply status effects like poison or disorientation.
	- Gameplay Impact : Environmental hazards require strategic movement and awareness, as well as specific abilities or resistances to mitigate their effects.
Players need to navigate these zones carefully to avoid extra health loss, particularly when hazards appear during boss encounters.

	In the underwater realms of the "World Game", environmental hazard zones can add significant challenges and excitement for players. These zones introduce unique
gameplay mechanics that players must navigate, enhancing the immersive experience of exploring the depths. Here are some ideas for environmental hazard zones:
