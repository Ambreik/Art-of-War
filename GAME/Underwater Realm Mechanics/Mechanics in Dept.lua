			Underwater Mechanics in Depth
			
		Bioluminescent Light and Limited Visibility

	In the "Underwater Realms" of the "World Game*", bioluminescent light serves as a critical gameplay mechanic. The ocean depths can be dark and foreboding, 
necessitating the use of light sources for navigation and exploration. This mechanic not only enhances the atmosphere but also impacts gameplay strategies, as 
players must manage their light sources to maximize exploration while avoiding detection by enemies or dangers in the dark.

1. "Bioluminescent Creatures" : 
	- The environment can be filled with bioluminescent plants and animals, creating a natural lighting effect that guides players through the underwater terrain. 
	Players can interact with these elements, possibly using them to illuminate areas or unlock new paths.

2. "Limited Visibility" :
	- Players face challenges due to limited visibility, which can be exacerbated by environmental factors such as murky waters or debris. This creates an 
atmosphere of suspense and exploration, encouraging players to rely on light sources to illuminate their surroundings.
	- Visibility can be affected by the depth of the water, requiring players to carefully navigate deeper areas while managing their light resources.

		Light-Emitting Items

	Hereâ€™s a list of light-emitting items that players can find or craft in the underwater realm, along with their mechanics:

1. "Glowing Coral Fragment" :
	- Description : A small fragment of coral that emits a soft blue-green glow.
	- Mechanic : When equipped, it provides a constant light radius of about 10 meters. It can also be placed in the environment as a light source, illuminating a 
small area. Players can collect these fragments in various underwater locations.

2. "Bioluminescent Lantern" :
	- Description : A lantern filled with bioluminescent algae that glows intensely.
	- Mechanic : This item has a limited duration (e.g., 30 minutes of glow time). Players can set it down or carry it, providing a larger radius of light 
(15 meters) and enhancing visibility during exploration. After its glow duration, it requires a cooldown period before it can be reactivated.

3. "Abyssal Lightstone" : 
	- Description : A mystical stone that pulses with a radiant light, rumored to be infused with the essence of "Horras".
	- Mechanic : When used, it creates a large area of illumination (20 meters) and reveals hidden treasures or pathways. However, it can attract the attention of 
underwater creatures, increasing the risk of ambushes. It has a single-use activation with a long cooldown period.

4. "Radiant Conch Shell" :
	- Description : A conch shell that emits a bright light when blown into, much like a horn.
	- Mechanic : Players can blow into the shell to create a burst of light, illuminating the surrounding area for a short time (5 seconds). This item can be used
strategically to navigate or disorient nearby enemies, providing a tactical advantage.

5. "Illuminating Potion" :
   - Description : A potion that, when consumed, grants the player temporary bioluminescence.
   - Mechanic : After consumption, the player glows brightly for a duration of 1 minute, illuminating a wide area and making it easier to explore dark corners of
the underwater realm. However, this glow can also make players more visible to enemies.

	By incorporating bioluminescent light and limited visibility into your underwater realm mechanics, players will engage in a more immersive experience that 
challenges their exploration skills while enhancing the atmosphere of mystery and adventure.
