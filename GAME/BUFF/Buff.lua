			Buffs
	
	In the "World Game", buffs refer to temporary beneficial effects that players can apply to enhance stats, increase attack, grant protection, or remove status 
effects. Buffs can vary based on how they are acquired and their specific effects. They fall into two main categories:

Time-Limited Buffs: These expire after a certain time.
Environment-Dependent Buffs: These depend on the player’s surroundings and have conditions, such as remaining in a specific area.

	Buff Mechanics
*Dismissing Buffs: Players can right-click a buff icon to remove it.
*Stacking Rules: Most buffs do not stack with similar ones, with exceptions like Heal Over Time (HoT) spells from multiple characters or different "HoT" spells from
the same character.
*Effects: Buffs can improve stats, increase attack, grant protection, and counteract debuffs or environmental disadvantages.
