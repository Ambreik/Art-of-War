			Reduced Healing

	Definition : "Reduced healing" refers to any effect, usually caused by debuffs, curses, or certain NPC abilities, that diminishes the effectiveness of healing spells or abilities. These effects reduce the amount of health a target can recover from healing sources, either by a percentage or entirely. 

		Types of Reduced Healing Effects  
1. "Debuffs" :  
   - These are negative effects placed on a character that reduce their healing efficiency. Debuffs can come from a variety of sources, such as enemy abilities, environmental hazards, or certain combat conditions.
   - Common debuffs that reduce healing include "Poison", "Bleed", "Fire", or "Curse" effects.  
   - "DoTs (Damage over Time" like poison, burn, or bleeding, also block natural health regeneration for the duration of the effect. This includes the base health regeneration that would normally occur over time.

2. Special Talents and Abilities :  
   - Certain talents, either from NPCs or players, can cause reduced healing. These are often linked to powerful monsters, bosses, or certain areas where healing is deliberately hindered.
   - Some abilities might reduce the effectiveness of healing spells entirely or lower the healing received by a certain percentage, making it harder to keep characters alive during combat.

	Examples of Reduced Healing by NPCs and Bosses  
- "Curse of the Underworld Devour" : This is a debuff placed by certain special monsters and bosses, particularly in the "Underworld" region. This curse greatly diminishes healing effectiveness, preventing or severely reducing the amount of healing received by affected characters.
- "Bosses" and "Special Monsters" : Many bosses in high-difficulty dungeons or other challenging encounters may have abilities or passive effects that reduce the healing they or their minions receive, forcing players to adapt their strategies.

	Impact in Combat  
- Healing Prevention : Reduced healing effects can make it significantly harder to recover health during prolonged engagements, especially during boss fights or in areas with strong environmental hazards. This requires players to use alternate tactics, such as healing potions, special buffs, or quick bursts of healing to compensate.
- Group Coordination : In group content, players must be aware of sources of reduced healing and may need to coordinate healing differently. Healers may have to use specific spells or timing to ensure that healing effects are maximized despite these reductions.
