			Healing

	Definition : "Healing" refers to the act of restoring health to a character or creature that has taken damage. In the context of the "World Game", healing can 
be achieved through various means, such as spells, abilities, items, or other forms of restorative effects.

	Types of Healing	  
1. "Health Repair" : Healing restores health to a target that has lost health, essentially repairing damage done during combat or other harmful situations. This is the most basic form of healing and includes spells or abilities that restore a characterâ€™s health points.

2. Healing Spells :  
   - Any spell that repairs health damage is considered a healing spell.
   - Healing spells are typically categorized as either direct heals (providing immediate health restoration) or HoTs (Heal over Time) (gradual healing over time). 
   - Healing spells specifically aimed at restoring health are distinct from drain spells, which transfer health from one character to another (such as life leech abilities).

3. Healing Debuffs :  
   - Reduced Healing Debuffs : Some enemies or abilities may apply debuffs that reduce the effectiveness of healing spells, making it harder to restore health during combat.
   - These debuffs can take various forms, such as reducing the amount of health healed or preventing healing entirely for a certain period.

		Significance in Combat  
	Healing is a vital aspect of group and solo combat. Effective healing can keep characters alive during tough battles and ensure sustained engagement with enemies.
Healers play a key role in groups, providing the necessary support to maintain the group's health, especially in challenging encounters or dungeons.

	Healing Sources  
- Spells : Primarily cast by "Healers" and "Sorcerers" and "Tank" classes, healing spells vary in strength and application methods. Some may heal over time (HoTs), while others deliver a burst of health instantly.
- Items : Potions, bandages, or other consumables that restore health can also be considered healing sources. These may be single-use or rechargeable items.
- Buffs : Some buffs or auras may provide passive healing effects that restore health periodically or in certain conditions, aiding long-term sustainability in battles.
