			Direct Heal

	Definition : 
	A "direct heal" is a healing effect that restores all of its healing in one instant application, rather than over a period of time like "Heal over Time" (HoT) 
effects. This type of healing is often used for urgent recovery, providing an immediate boost to a characterâ€™s health.

	Key Characteristics	
- "Instant Healing" : Unlike HoT effects that provide healing gradually, direct heals restore health in a single burst. This makes them effective for quickly recovering health in high-stakes combat situations.
  
- Aggro Generation :  
   - "Direct Heals" cause aggro all at once when the heal is applied.
   - In contrast, "HoTs" generate aggro incrementally with each tick of healing.
   - For each point of health healed, direct heals and HoTs generate equivalent amounts of aggro, but direct heals create a larger spike at once.

- Block Heals : Direct heals are sometimes referred to as block heals, as they apply the healing in one single instance rather than over time, making them useful for absorbing large amounts of incoming damage quickly.

	Class Abilities	  
- "Guardians" and "Barons" (Shaman-type Classes) have access to skills that provide "Direct Heal" to their owner while in combat. These abilities can be used strategically to keep tanks or primary combatants alive during intense battles.
