			DeBUFF Description  

	A debuff is the opposite of a buff. It is an effect that hinders the target in some way while it persists. Among its many effects, debuffs can:  
- Lower attributes (e.g., strength, agility, or health).  
- Hinder the effectiveness of the target's actions (e.g., slowing attacks, reducing healing).  
- Inflict damage over time (DoTs).  

	Occasionally, the term "debuff" is also used to describe the act of removing buffs from hostile targets. However, this action is more commonly referred to as a 
"dispel" or "cure," named after the common abilities or spells used for this purpose.  

	Debuffs come in various forms and are often tied to specific race/class abilities or spells.

		Limitations  

- There is no effective limit on the number of debuffs that can be applied to a target at one time.  
- Similar debuffs do not stack with each other, except for certain exceptions like damage over time effects (DoTs).  
	- Multiple instances of the same DoT will usually stack if applied by different players.  
	- Boss monsters can stack several copies of the same DoT on a single player.

		Combating Debuffs

class typically counters that debuff type.
