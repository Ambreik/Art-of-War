			Diminishing Returns

		Overview
	"Diminishing returns" (DR) refers to the system where certain abilities, when used repeatedly within a short period of time, become progressively 
less effective against the same target. This mechanic is primarily applied in "PvP", although certain abilities in "PvE" can also experience DR. The 
concept is especially relevant in crowd control (CC) effects like "stuns", "roots", and "fear".

	Core Mechanics

1. "PvP Diminishing Returns"
   - The first use of an ability with DR on a target has its full effect (PvP duration).
   - If an ability from the same DR category is used again on the same target within 18 seconds, its effect is reduced by 50%.
   - The third use of the same effect will reduce the duration by "75%".
   - After the third use, the target becomes "immune" to any effect from that category for 18 seconds.
   - DR resets if 18 seconds pass without any usage of the same ability category on the target.

2. "Maximum PvP Duration" : The maximum duration of DR effects in PvP is capped at 8 seconds.

3. "Special Cases" :
   - "Knockbacks" : Immediately immune after the first use, with a reset period of 10 seconds (different from other DR types).
   - "Taunts" : Aggravate effects for mobs or pets reset every 18 seconds, but immunity starts after five uses, unlike other DR categories that 
activate after three uses.

	PvE Diminishing Returns

- In PvE scenarios, "crowd control" effects also experience diminishing returns but apply individually per creature. 
  - Diminishing returns do not affect all players in a raid or party at once, and they apply on a per-creature basis.
  - "Stuns" are the most common type of DR in PvE.

	Diminishing Returns Categories
1. "Roots"
   - All root effects now share a unified DR category.
   
2. "Stuns"
   - All stun effects now share the same DR category.

3. "Incapacitate" (formerly separate)  
   - All incapacitates now share the same DR category, and this category has been merged with "Horror" DR.

4. "Fear"
   - The "Fear" DR category has been merged with "Disorient" (sometimes referred to as "Mesmerize").

5. "Silence"
   - Silence effects have their own DR category.

6. "AoE Knockbacks"
   - A specific DR category is dedicated to AoE knockback effects.

	Key DR Mechanics Summary  
- Same category of effects (e.g., root, stun, etc.) will be less effective if used repeatedly within 18 seconds of the previous effect's duration.
- "Knockback" and "Taunt" have special rules with different timings compared to other DR types.

	General Rules
- DR resets : Effects will reset after 18 seconds without an effect from the same category being used on a target.
- PvP durations are generally shorter than the tooltip duration (maximum of 8 seconds).
- Immunity kicks in after a third use in most DR categories, except for "Taunts" where immunity kicks in after "five uses".
