			Key

	There are a few types of keys:

- Key for Containers  
  An item that can be used to unlock a specific or general type of locked container. Blacksmiths can create certain keys and use them. These keys are 
destroyed upon use. Containers requiring keys may include chests, vaults, or other locked storage systems that hold valuable items, resources, or 
quest-related objects.

- Soulbound Keys  
  A usually soulbound item (often a quest reward) that can be used to unlock specific doors, gates, hatches, or other barriers within the game world. 
These keys are often tied to quests or certain areas, ensuring players cannot share or sell them once acquired.

- Quest Item Keys  
  Quest item keys are used for specific quests or tasks. An example would be the "Tower Key" required for the party to open the pillars and complete a
floor request. This key is picked up and consumed each time a "RUN" occurs. It is not exactly a standard quest item but is the only way to open the 
cannon, and it is consumed upon use. These keys cannot be used anywhere else in the game.

		Keybag	

	The keybag is a button found in the status bar, next to the inventory button.  
	It is an expandable bag that can store various types of keys, reducing the number of inventory slots used to store them. All "World Game" 
keys—whether picked up, crafted, or received as rewards—are stored inside this keybag for easy access.

		Lock Picking

	Lock Picking is a profession learned at level 30 by any class except for "Assassins," who already have Rank I of this skill from the start of 
their character creation. Using this profession, players can open most locked containers or doors that would otherwise require a key. However, there 
are a few high-level dungeon doors that cannot be opened by Lock Picking.

		Mechanics

	Once used, a key is destroyed in the process. A key does not guarantee a 100% success rate in opening a locked door or chest. However, the higher 
the player's **Lock Picking** profession, the higher the chance of success when applying the skill. This applies to most locked containers, but some 
may still require specific keys or higher-tier skills to unlock.
