			Farming

	In the context of gaming, "farming" refers to the repetitive activity of collecting items, resources, or in-game currency, typically through the 
defeat of specific monsters or collection of crafting materials. Unlike "grinding", which focuses primarily on gaining experience points, farming is 
centered on obtaining "valuable loot" that can be used for crafting, selling, or fulfilling quest requirements. The dropped items, such as crafting 
materials, are usually unaffected by the player's level or experience, making farming a consistent activity regardless of advancement.

	Types of Farming

1. "Monster Farming" :  
   Players often engage in monster farming, where they target specific types of enemies that drop desirable items. For example, "tailors" may farm 
humanoids that drop cloth, while "leatherworkers" target beasts for leather. In these cases, players repeatedly kill the same types of mobs to 
accumulate a particular material. Some players may even farm elite or rare monsters that reside in dungeons or special zones known for dropping high-
value items, such as rare armor, weapons, or enchantments.

2. "Material Farming" :  
   Another popular form of farming involves collecting gatherable resources such as "herbs", "ores*", and "wood". Unlike monster farming, this type of
farming doesnt always require combat but relies on the exploration and collection of natural resources in the game world. Many professions, such as 
"alchemy", "blacksmithing", or "cooking", require these materials, making gathering a crucial part of the crafting system.

3. "Quest-Related Farming" :  
   Farming also plays a key role in many in-game quests. For example, players might need to farm specific monsters to obtain "research materials" for
"biologist" quests or to help faction reputation. These quests often require the collection of items from particular mobs, sometimes demanding the 
defeat of specific bosses or elite enemies that drop unique quest items.

4. "Farming for Reputation and Progression" :  
   Many factions in games, particularly MMORPGs, require players to farm mobs as part of their reputation system. Players often need to repeatedly 
kill certain creatures to build rapport with a faction, unlocking new quests, crafting recipes, or special items in the process. This repetitive 
activity forms an essential part of faction-based progression, as earning higher ranks with a faction often grants exclusive rewards or abilities.

	Alternative Definitions of Farming

- "Crafting Material Collection" :  
   A more expansive definition of farming includes the collection of crafting materials such as ores, herbs, or other resources, which can be found 
while exploring the game world or through harvesting. While not always involving combat, this type of farming still carries the repetitive nature of 
gathering resources needed for crafting, often requiring players to visit the same locations to gather rare or necessary components.

- "Farming  the Auction House (AH)" :  
   A more economically-oriented form of farming involves farming the auction house. This term is used humorously to describe the act of buying items 
at a low price from other players and reselling them at a higher price for a profit. This "farming" technique doesn't require grinding mobs or 
collecting resources but focuses instead on in-game economics and market speculation.

		The Benefits of Farming

	Farming provides several key advantages to players:

- "Crafting and Professions" : Accumulating materials is essential for crafting, which can lead to the creation of powerful weapons, armor, and 
consumables, enhancing a player's in-game strength.
- "Increased Gold" : Players who engage in farming for rare items or auction house flipping can accumulate wealth, which can be spent on items, 
services, or progression.
- "Reputation and Rewards" : Farming mobs for specific items can help players advance their reputation with factions, unlock special rewards, or 
complete important quests that unlock further progression.
- "Exploration and World Interaction" : Farming encourages exploration and interaction with the world, whether itâ€™s clearing out an enemy encampment, 
harvesting rare herbs, or gathering ores from dangerous areas.

		Criticism of Farming

	While farming can be rewarding, it also faces some criticism for being repetitive and monotonous. Many players find that endless farming for 
materials or items can become tedious and detracts from the enjoyment of the game's main narrative or activities. The act of repetitively killing the 
same enemies or collecting similar resources can sometimes feel like a grind, leading to player burnout if not balanced properly.
