			Instance
			
	Instance Description : An Instance in our "World Game" represents a distinct and highly challenging portion of a dungeon or a unique environment 
designed for a limited group of players. Unlike open-world dungeons, instances are specialized, requiring players to group up and enter together with 
specific conditions, including preparation for complex mechanics, elite monsters, special bosses, and notorious creatures. The access to instances is 
limited either daily, weekly, or even monthly, making them a significant and rare challenge that rewards high-level teamwork, strategy, and 
preparation.

	Key Characteristics of Instances :
1. Limited Access : Players can only enter an instance a set number of times per day, week, or month. Once a player has used their allocated entry, 
they must wait until the next period to attempt again. For guilds, this entry system is tied to the guild leader, who can also book appointments for 
the entire guild, provided they meet the requirements for the instance.
   
2. Elite and Special Enemies : Instances are filled with powerful monsters that are far more dangerous than regular dungeon mobs. They feature 
"Special Monsters", "Special Bosses", and "Notorious Monsters", all of which require careful planning and coordination to defeat. These monsters often
come with unique abilities, mechanics, and strategies that make them more challenging than anything found in regular dungeons.

3. High Difficulty and Strategy : The complexity of instances demands meticulous preparation. Players must plan ahead by stockpiling consumables, 
crafting top-tier equipment, and developing strategies tailored to the specific instance. The enemies within the instance are tougher, and the 
environment may introduce unique hazards or traps that require a well-coordinated effort to navigate.

4. Group Requirements : While dungeons can sometimes be tackled solo, instances always require a full party to enter. Players cannot access an 
instance on their own; they must be part of a group of players who are ready to face the challenges together. This enforces the social and cooperative
aspects of the game, encouraging teamwork and coordination among party members.

5. Guild Participation : Guilds can access instances in a unique way. Instead of needing a traditional group, guild members can enter as part of a 
guild-wide effort. The guild leader has the exclusive ability to book the entire guild’s entry into an instance, making this a feature for organized, 
large-scale guild activities. Guilds can send up to 30 members without the need for group formation, but all must meet the instance's access 
requirements. 

    - Open World Access : Guild members can access the instance with any player, even from other guilds, but this mode reduces the chances of item 
drops significantly. 
    - Guild Party Access : When members enter as part of their own guild’s party, they enjoy the full benefits of loot rewards, though the loot is 
divided into categories based on the specific participation model (guild-based or open-world).

6. Loot and Rewards : Instances offer a much more significant and valuable loot table compared to standard dungeons. Items obtained from instances are
often rare, powerful, and expensive, making them highly sought after by players. The "Loot Table" for instances is designed to reward players with 
higher-tier equipment, materials, and sometimes unique items that cannot be found elsewhere in the game world. However, due to the tougher mechanics 
and longer time commitment, these rewards are proportionally more valuable than those dropped in standard dungeons.

	- Loot Categories : Loot is categorized into two distinct categories:
		- Open World Loot : Items obtained when a guild member enters an instance with random players from different guilds or parties. These items 
are typically less valuable and are more likely to be shared among the group.
		- Guild Party Loot : Items obtained when entering an instance with only guild members. These drops have higher values, and the loot is more 
focused on rewarding the guild as a whole.

7. Time Investment : Due to the complexity and the necessity of teamwork, completing an instance generally takes much longer than a standard dungeon. 
Players will need to dedicate significant amounts of time to complete these challenges. The longer durations, in conjunction with the difficult 
mechanics and dangerous monsters, make instances an investment for dedicated teams.

8. Unique Instance Channels : When a group enters an instance, they are placed into a unique instance channel. Each group gets their own version of 
the instance, ensuring that no other groups can interfere or disrupt their progress. If multiple groups enter the same instance at the same time, they
will be placed into parallel versions of the instance. This system prevents overlapping groups from competing for resources, enemies, or loot, and 
ensures each group has an uninterrupted experience.

	Instance Mechanics

- Party Composition : Since instances require full party participation, certain roles such as tanks, healers, and damage dealers are essential for 
success. Depending on the type of instance, a balanced composition may be necessary, with each player contributing their unique abilities to the 
encounter.
  
- Entry Process : Players must first approach the "Guardians" or "Keepers" stationed at the entrance to the instance. These NPCs act as gatekeepers, 
granting permission for players to enter. For guild members, only the guild leader can initiate the entry process, which will grant the 
entire guild access for their scheduled entry time.

- Cooldowns and Restrictions : Instances are designed to prevent players from repeatedly farming them. After completing an instance, players will have
to wait until their allotted time (daily, weekly, or monthly) to re-enter. This cooldown encourages careful planning and prevents players from over-
farming high-value rewards.

- Achievements : Instances often come with special achievements, such as defeating a notorious boss, completing the instance under certain conditions,
or finishing it within a specific time limit. Achievements are tracked, and players can earn rewards such as unique titles, cosmetic items, or 
additional loot drops for completing them successfully.
