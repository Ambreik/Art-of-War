	1. The Obsidian Wastes

- Description : The Obsidian Wastes are a vast, harsh desert of jagged, blackened stone. The terrain is fractured, and toxic mists rise from fissures, forcing players to move with caution. Shards of cursed obsidian float ominously in the air, casting strange, moving shadows across the landscape.
- Environmental Hazards :
  - "Toxic Gas Fissures" : Poison clouds that drain health over time and weaken stamina.
  - "Shadow Stalkers" : Stealthy, swift creatures that blend into the shadows cast by floating obsidian shards, ambushing players.

	3. The Black River

- Description : The Black River is a dark, winding stream that flows through the Underworld. The water is opaque, and whispers rise from it like mist. It divides different territories and serves as both a barrier and a path to new zones.
- Environmental Hazards :
  - "Echoing Whispers" : Players hear whispers from the river, applying the "Memory Drain" debuff, which lowers health recovery but increases magic power.
  - "Spectral Barges" : Ghostly ferries that occasionally pass by. Players can use them to reach hidden areas, but they risk being ambushed by spirits.
- Special Encounters :
  - "River Guardians" : Spirits who protect relics in the river. Players must defeat them to retrieve important items.
  - "The Ferryman" : A spectral figure who offers transport across the river or challenges players with riddles.

- Environmental Hazards :
  - "Twisting Corridors" : Hallways that shift, causing players to become lost if they aren't careful. 
  - "Spectral Wards" : Wards that apply debuffs like "Shadow Fatigue" and "Echo of Pain", which can be disabled by finding hidden runestones.
- Special Encounters :
  - "The Warden of the Shadows" : A powerful spectral warrior with high resistance to physical damage. Players must use elemental damage or curse-breaking spells to defeat him.

	6. The Ferryman and River Crossing

- Description : The Black River divides the Underworld into different regions. The Ferryman, resembling the mythological Charon, offers transport across the river, but each trip requires a payment.
- Special Mechanics :

	7. The Gates of Luminara

- Description : Ancient gates that serve as passageways between Underworld zones. These gates glow with a cold, ghostly light and offer temporary sanctuary.

	8. Underworld Minerals: Shadowstone & Abyssal Gas
