			Settlement**  

	Settlements are areas where people gather to live, ranging from small villages with only a handful of people to bustling cities that house thousands of souls. 
These settlements can vary greatly in size, purpose, and services offered.

		City  
	Cities are large settlements where people live, typically much larger than towns. They are often surrounded by tall walls, offering protection from external 
threats, especially if they are the capital of a faction or nation. Cities usually have a strong military presence to protect their citizens.  
	Cities are also hubs for trade, commerce, and services, providing essential facilities to support their population, such as banks, inns, auction houses, and 
more. Some cities, especially those that serve as capitals, will offer a wide variety of amenities, including trainers, vendors, and faction leaders. All faction capitals in the game must include an "auction house" , "bank" and "Faction Leader".

		Village/Town  
	Villages or towns are smaller settlements that donâ€™t reach the size of cities, but they still support a decent population and a variety of structures. While 
towns are larger than villages, the distinction between the two can sometimes be unclear. Towns typically feature vendors and may have Mount/Pet Masters, but they 
generally lack larger facilities like banks or auction houses.  
	Inns are more common in towns than in villages, though they are not guaranteed. Villages and towns are often located along roads connecting larger cities,raids,
or regions, making them important stopping points for travelers and adventurers. In human lands, the people who live in these settlements are often referred to as "villagers".

		Camp  
	Camps are the smallest of settlements, usually consisting of tents and temporary structures. They lack the significant infrastructure of villages or towns, but 
they often provide basic services like NPC vendors, quest-giving characters, and occasionally profession buildings like forges.  
	If a camp is large enough, it may feature additional services like crafting stations or small shops. Camps are scattered throughout the world and serve as 
waypoints for travelers and adventurers. They may also be referred to as "posts" or "forward camps", and are often used by various races as temporary shelters 
during explorations, raids, or military campaigns.
