			Dungeon

	Dungeon Description : A Dungeon is a specially designated area within the game world, typically characterized by its perilous environment, 
challenging enemies, intricate layouts, and rewarding loot. Dungeons serve as both a key aspect of the game's content progression and a space for 
immersive storytelling, offering players unique challenges and opportunities for teamwork, exploration, and discovery.

	In our "World Game", Dungeons are varied in their design and purpose, catering to both solo and group play. They can be located in remote, 
hard-to-reach areas, in the heart of dangerous regions, or even within hidden or forgotten structures of ancient civilizations. Each dungeon is 
designed to push the player's skills, resourcefulness, and teamwork to the limit, rewarding successful adventurers with rare treasures, powerful 
items, and story revelations. 

	Dungeons come in different forms and sizes, from small, single-chamber chambers filled with traps and puzzles to expansive, multi-level labyrinths
filled with elite monsters and complex environmental challenges. In some instances, players may need to utilize special mechanics, such as activating 
switches, solving environmental puzzles, or navigating tricky terrain to progress deeper into the dungeon.

	Types of Dungeons
1. Solo Dungeons : These are designed for individual players, usually for exploring or collecting resources or completing quests. The difficulty may 
scale based on the player's level, ensuring that solo adventurers are adequately challenged without overwhelming them.

2. Group Dungeons : These dungeons require a party of players to navigate and conquer. They may feature bosses that require careful strategy,teamwork,
and communication to defeat. Group dungeons often have multiple roles, such as tanking, healing, and damage dealing, that require coordination to 
succeed.

3. World Dungeons : Larger, open-world dungeons that may not have a specific entrance. These dungeons are often associated with larger events or world
bosses and can involve multiple players across the game world working together to clear them. 

4. Cave Dungeons : These are natural dungeons found in caves, underground ruins, or cavern systems. They might be more atmospheric, requiring players 
to rely on their senses to navigate and detect hidden threats. The environment often poses hazards such as collapsing floors, tight spaces, or poison 
gas.

5. Temple Dungeons : Built into the structures of ancient or mystical temples, these dungeons are filled with intricate puzzles, traps, and hidden 
chambers. Often associated with religious or arcane power, temple dungeons challenge players' ability to decipher lore and solve environmental 
puzzles.

6. Undead Dungeons : Ruins, catacombs, and graveyards where the dead have risen again. These dungeons typically feature undead enemies, curses, and 
traps related to necromancy. They may also include puzzles that involve dealing with the spirits of the deceased or navigating through areas laden 
with dark magic.

7. Dungeon Raids : Large-scale challenges meant for guilds or large groups of players, often involving a series of encounters with various bosses and 
challenges. Raids typically require a high level of coordination, with players taking on specific roles to overcome the challenges.

		Dungeon Mechanics

	Dungeons in our "World Game" are more than just locations to explore—they’re designed to be dynamic and immersive experiences that contribute to 
the larger world-building and narrative. Players will encounter not only physical threats but also environmental challenges such as navigating mazes, 
solving puzzles, and evading traps. Some dungeons may involve role-based mechanics, such as puzzles requiring certain character abilities, teamwork to
defeat certain bosses, or environmental challenges where players need to manipulate objects or use unique items to advance.

		Dungeon Lore and Storytelling

	Each dungeon is designed with a rich backstory, contributing to the game world’s deep lore. Dungeons are often the remnants of past civilizations,
the hideouts of dangerous enemies, or the lairs of powerful creatures. The stories within these dungeons may unfold through journal entries, 
environmental storytelling, or encounters with NPCs or quest givers. Dungeons are key narrative elements, giving players the chance to uncover lost 
histories, forgotten secrets, or dark plots that shape the world around them.

		Dungeon Progression and Difficulty

	Dungeon difficulty can scale depending on the progression of the player or group. A basic dungeon might present some minor challenges, while 
endgame dungeons can feature high-level bosses, complex mechanics, and environmental obstacles. Additionally, certain dungeons may have multiple 
difficulty tiers, offering higher rewards for greater risks. In some cases, dungeons may feature procedural generation, meaning that each visit could 
present a new challenge or layout, keeping the gameplay fresh and unpredictable.

	Key Dungeon Features :
- Loot : Dungeons often provide valuable rewards such as rare equipment, materials for crafting, or other special items tied to quests or character 
progression.
- Respawn Mechanics : Dungeons may feature specific rules for respawn rates of enemies, loot, and bosses, often based on player actions, quest 
progression, or time.
- Boss Fights : Many dungeons culminate in battles with formidable bosses that require strategy, special tactics, or specific team compositions to 
defeat.
- Environment and Exploration : Navigating the dungeon may include avoiding traps, unlocking secret areas, or finding hidden passages that reward 
players for exploration.
