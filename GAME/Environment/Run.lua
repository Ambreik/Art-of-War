			Run

	Run Description : A "Run" in our "World Game" is a challenging, time-sensitive event located within various structures like temples, caves, 
fortresses, or ruins. Players must work together in groups to complete a series of progressively harder objectives, often under strict time 
constraints. These locations are designed to test teamwork, coordination, and individual skill in navigating complex mechanics, defeating formidable 
monsters, and overcoming increasingly difficult layers or floors.

	Each "Run" features multiple floors or stages, with certain floors containing a time limit to complete specific tasks in order to advance to the 
next level. The complexity of the objectives grows as players ascend through the layers, culminating in a final confrontation with a powerful boss, 
often featuring special mechanics, multiple phases, and potentially multiple HP bars to deplete before victory can be achieved.

	Key Characteristics of Runs :

1. Layered Objectives : Runs are structured in layers or floors, with each floor presenting its own unique challenges and monsters. As players 
progress deeper into the structure, the difficulty increases. Some layers require players to complete specific tasks, such as solving puzzles, 
defeating special enemies, or surviving waves of monsters, all within a time limit.

2. Timer-Driven Challenges : One of the defining features of a "Run" is its time-sensitive nature.Each layer or floor typically has a countdown timer,
and players must accomplish specific objectives before the time runs out. This creates a sense of urgency and adds a layer of strategy, as players 
need to balance speed with careful execution to avoid failing the challenge.

3. Complex Monsters and Bosses : Much like "Instances", the monsters in "Runs" are elite and come with complex mechanics that require players to adapt
quickly. These monsters are designed to challenge even well-prepared teams, with abilities that force players to coordinate their movements and 
attacks carefully. Some of the bosses in "Runs" are "Notorious Monsters", capable of devastating the group if not properly dealt with. Additionally, 
certain final bosses may have multiple HP bars, requiring sustained effort to defeat and presenting additional phases or mechanics with each phase.

4. Difficulty and Strategy : Similar to "Instances", the difficulty in "Runs" is high. Players must prepare thoroughly, utilizing consumables, 
crafting better gear, and coming up with effective strategies. Group coordination is critical, as runs require a well-balanced team with players 
fulfilling specific roles such as tanking, healing, and dealing damage.

5. Teamwork and Group Play : Like "Instances", "Runs" are designed to be tackled by a full group of players, typically requiring a balanced team of 
multiple roles. The teamwork element is essential for success, as the challenges within the run are difficult to overcome solo or with underprepared 
teams.

6. Final Boss and Rewards : At the end of each "Run", players are typically required to face a powerful boss. The final boss often comes with 
intricate mechanics, multiple forms or phases, and the possibility of being a "Notorious Monster" with unique abilities. The boss may have several HP 
bars, meaning players need to manage resources, plan their attacks, and adjust strategies as the fight progresses. Upon defeating the boss, players 
are rewarded with high-tier loot and potential achievements, making successful completion of a "Run" a highly sought-after goal.

7. Timed Entry and Difficulty Scaling : Like "Instances", players are limited in how often they can attempt "Runs", either on a daily, weekly, or 
monthly basis. This restricts the ability to farm them endlessly and adds a layer of challenge as players must prepare and time their entries. Some 
"Runs" may offer different difficulty levels, allowing players to choose between easier or more challenging versions of the same Run, with the harder 
versions offering more valuable rewards.

8. Run Challenges : Within the run, players may encounter additional challenges such as:
	- Timed puzzles : These require players to solve specific challenges or riddles before the time runs out.
	- Environmental hazards : These could include traps, environmental damage, or floors that collapse after a certain period.
	- Elite waves : Players may need to survive against waves of elite monsters before they can proceed to the next level.
	- Special tasks : Some runs may include special objectives, such as protecting NPCs or carrying objects to certain points while defending against 
enemy attacks.
