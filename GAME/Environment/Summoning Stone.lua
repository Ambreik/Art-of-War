			Summoning Stone

	Summoning Stones are ancient, towering structures scattered throughout the "World Game," primarily located within the "Outland Territories". These stones are 
used for teleportation, allowing players to travel between major cities and other remote locations instantly. They are fixed in place, and players can use them 
without any cost, making them vital for fast travel in the game world.

- "Frozen Territory" : Icy-colored smoke with a gloomy effect.
- "Lagooma Jungle" : Gray smoke swirling around the base.
- "Tenebress Territory" : Dark red smoke with thick, dense fumes.

		Location & Accessibility
	Summoning Stones are located in remote, secluded areas. Their positions are not shown on the map or radar, making them difficult to locate. Players will need to
explore the Outland Territories to discover their locations. Once found, they provide a quick and instant way to travel between regions, provided the player meets 
the level or other requirements for the region they wish to teleport to. These stones act as crucial shortcuts, enabling players to bypass long journeys across 
dangerous or remote lands.
