			Party Buff

	"Group Buffs" are a highly efficient method for distributing beneficial spells to multiple members of a group simultaneously. They help conserve both mana and 
time while ensuring that the entire group gains an advantage in combat or preparation. Group buffs generally have a longer duration than their single-target 
equivalents.

	Group buffs can affect not only the primary target but also other similar targets within the group or raid. This feature makes them an essential mechanic for 
maintaining team effectiveness during dungeons, raids, and PvP scenarios.

	Party Buff Rules and Mechanics

	"Casting Rules"
	When casting a "Party Buff", the following conditions must be met:
1. "Target Requirements" :
	- The "spell target" must be:
		- "Friendly" (cannot target enemies).
		- "In line of sight" of the caster.
		- "Within the caster's range".  
2. "PvP Flag Mechanics" :
	- If the target is "flagged for PvP", the caster will also become flagged for PvP upon casting the buff.  
	- This ensures balance during PvP and prevents unintended buffs from creating unfair advantages.  
3. "Buff Application" :
	- The target gains the buff immediately after the spell is cast.

		Group Buff Splash Effect
	A unique feature of group buffs is their ability to "splash" the buff effect to other group members. The splash mechanics operate as follows:

1. "Effect Distribution" :
	- All characters in the target's party within the spell’s range, including pets and summons, receive the buff.  
	- The splash effect is not restricted by "line of sight", allowing the caster to buff players who are out of view but within range.

2. "Exclusions" :
	- Characters "excluded" from the splash effect include:
		- Players whose level is lower than the spell’s "trained level".
		- Players who are flagged for "PvP" while the caster is not.  

3. "Double Range Buffing" :
	- The splash effect effectively doubles the buffing range, enabling the caster to buff players further away as long as the primary target is within range.

		Challenges and Preparation in PvP and Raids

	"PvP Buffing Dynamics" :
- PvP flags can disrupt group buffing during raid preparation or world events.  
- To ensure smooth application of buffs:
	1. Groups may wait for PvP flags to expire on flagged members.
	2. Alternatively, buffing classes may voluntarily flag themselves for PvP to synchronize statuses.

	"Mana Efficiency" :
- Group buffs are designed to be mana-efficient, as they apply a single spell’s effect across multiple targets.  
- This efficiency is critical during extended battles where resource management is key to survival.

		Strategic Usage of Party Buffs

	Pre-Combat Preparation
- Party buffs are typically cast during pre-combat phases :
	- Before entering a dungeon, raid, or battleground.
	- During strategic pauses in long engagements to refresh buffs.
	- As a rallying action before attacking world bosses or engaging in PvP skirmishes.  

	Combat Enhancement
- Buff effects can provide the following benefits to party members:
	- Increased "damage output".
	- Enhanced "defensive capabilities".
	- Boosted "healing efficiency".
	- Improved "resource regeneration" (e.g., mana or stamina).
