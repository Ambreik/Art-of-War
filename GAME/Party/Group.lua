			Group

	A "Group" is a collection of player characters who band together to achieve shared goals. Forming a group provides numerous advantages, including private 
communication, shared experience (XP), collaborative quest progression, and organized loot distribution. Groups are essential for efficient teamwork and enhanced 
gameplay in "World Game".

	The group leader has special privileges and can enhance the group's effectiveness through various actions:
1. "Assign Passive Skills or Buffs" :  
	- Leaders with the "Leadership Skill" can assign passive abilities or buffs to party members.  
	- These abilities include enhanced healing, defensive boosts, and offensive bonuses, depending on the leader’s learned skills and class.

2. "Special Buffs by Class" :  
	- " Healer" : Grants powerful healing auras and restorative abilities to party members.  
	- "Warlock Sorcerer" : Provides magical shields, increased mana regeneration, or damage amplification.

     - Reading Books : Found in libraries or as rare loot.

		Monster Groups
	In the world of "World Game", monsters can also form groups, led by a stronger or higher-level creature. 

1. "Monster Group Characteristics" :
   - Consist of 3 or more monsters of the same race or element.  
   - Attacking one member of a group triggers the entire group to retaliate.  

2. "Instance Monster Groups" :  
   - Larger groups, often found in "Instances", are more challenging and strategically designed.  
   - "Mystic Stones" : Attacking these stones summons massive groups of monsters, creating a high-risk, high-reward scenario.

		Rank Points and Group Mechanics

	Joining a group affects "Rank Points", especially during "PvP encounters". Killing other players in free mode while in a group modifies rank dynamics compared 
to solo actions.

	Rank Point Loss in PvP
- If a group kills a player from the same faction, each group member loses Rank Points based on the number of players in the group.

|   Number of Players in Group   |    Rank Point Loss (per member   |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 2 Players                      | -100 Points                      |
| 3 Players                      | -67 Points                       |
| 4 Players                      | -50 Points                       |
| 5 Players                      | -40 Points                       |
| 6 Players                      | -33 Points                       |
| 7 Players                      | -28 Points                       |
| 8 Players                      | -25 Points                       |

	Faction Difference
- When the victim belongs to an opposing faction, only the attacker receives Rank Points.  
- The points gained depend on the victim's:
	- "Level"  
	- "Class"  
	- "Special circumstances" (e.g., the victim's current rank, involvement in PvP objectives).
