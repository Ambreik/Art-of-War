			Map

	In "World Game," the term map usually refers to the World Map, which is accessible from the map button on the minimap located at the bottom right corner 
(or by using the default key shortcut: "M").

	A map is a comprehensive visual representation of the entire zone, including all areas.Players can zoom in or select specific areas to open them in a larger view.
A map cannot display an entire continent at once, but only the zone in which the character is currently located when the "Map UI" is opened.

	Features of the Map:
- "Area Details" : The map contains all the details of the area, including NPCs, which are placed exactly where they are in real time. You can use the cursor to point
to coordinates of NPCs.
	- "NPCs" : NPCs are displayed on the map as small green square dots.
  
- "Party Members" : If you are in a party, all party members will be shown on the map.
	- "Party Member Indicators" : Each party member is marked with a blue dot. The party leader is marked with a red dot.

- "Resource Tracking" : Characters who have learned to track specific resources (e.g., mines, herbs, or Bosses) can see them in real time on the map. This is an easy way to locate specific spawns, but the character must be in that area to track the resources.
	- "Resource Indicators" : These resources are displayed as small yellow square dots. Bosses are shown with a small skull symbol.
  
- "Bounty Hunters" : Bounty Hunters have an ability that alters the map when activated. The map becomes slightly blurred in a specific area, indicating the general location of their target. The location is not precise, but the blurred area is wide enough to give players a rough idea of where to search.
	- "Bounty Hunter Indicator" : This ability can be used once with a cooldown of one hour. If the target moves from that location, the map will no longer remain blurred in that area.
