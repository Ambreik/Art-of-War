			Dungeon

	"Dungeons" in "World Game" serve as critical, challenging areas designed for party-based adventuring and cooperation. These confined spaces—often tombs, caves, 
ruins, castles, and other forsaken locations—are inhabited by powerful enemies and formidable bosses. Dungeons are meant to push adventurers to their limits, 
offering new challenges with every step. 

		Dungeon Types

1. "Standard Dungeons" : These are the core of party-based dungeons, designed to be completed by a team. Players can form a party themselves or use the Dungeon Finder tool to queue for a specific or random dungeon. These dungeons typically consist of multiple areas filled with elite monsters and powerful bosses.

2. "Soloable Dungeons" : While most dungeons require a group of adventurers to complete, some smaller dungeons are designed to be soloed. These dungeons allow players to tackle them independently, often providing opportunities for skilled solo players to earn loot and experience in a more intimate setting.

3. "Cross-Faction Party Dungeons" : Dungeons in the World Game support cross-faction collaboration, meaning players from different factions (such as the Outlaws or official factions) can team up to tackle the same challenges. This promotes cooperation between opposing factions, enriching the social aspect of the game.

4. "Instances" : Some dungeons are marked as instances—special areas that exist in parallel realms, separate from the main world. These instances allow for a more isolated, private experience with no interference from other players or factions. Instances are often used for high-difficulty content or boss battles.

	Dungeon Mechanics

- Party Composition : A valid dungeon party usually consists of a balanced composition, including one tank, one healer, and at least three damage dealers. Some dungeons might allow for more or fewer members depending on the difficulty and requirements of the content.
  
- Dungeon Difficulty : Dungeons vary in difficulty, and each has a recommended level range. As players progress through regions, dungeons scale in difficulty, introducing tougher enemies and more complex mechanics. Dungeon difficulty can be adjusted for varying player abilities, with higher difficulty settings providing more rewards but also significantly increasing the challenge.

- Loot and Rewards : Dungeon bosses drop a range of loot, typically Uncommon, Rare, and occasionally Epic items. As players venture into dungeons from the Outland Territories and Legrand, loot quality improves, with Rare and Epic items being more common. Some dungeons also feature special items or unique rewards, which might be required for progression or for achieving higher-level goals.

- Dungeon Finder Tool : Players can use the Dungeon Finder tool to quickly locate groups for dungeons, either by searching for specific dungeons or random queues. This system helps streamline dungeon content, making it easier for players to access the dungeons they want to tackle.

		Megadungeons

	"Megadungeons" are a unique type of dungeon—vast, multi-level areas with expansive content and complex objectives. Unlike regular dungeons, Megadungeons offer 
players the opportunity to conquer vast stretches of terrain, uncover hidden secrets, and defeat formidable bosses in long, intense sessions. 
	Megadungeons require a larger time commitment than standard dungeons, and they are only available during specific periods. Players can attempt to complete 
Megadungeon challenges from Monday at 01:00 AM to Friday at 11:00 PM. At the weekend, players can challenge previously encountered bosses in the Megadungeon at 
intervals. They are allowed to face bosses up to three times per day, providing an opportunity to farm them for unique rewards.

	Currently known Megadungeons include:
- "Lavander Grotto" : Located in the Lagooma Jungle of the third region.
- "Tomb of Great Crusaders" : Situated in Netar Island.
- "Dungeon of Guilds" : Accessible only by members of an Order/Clan (guild). This Megadungeon is an exclusive area for guild members, found within their territory. 
Only players who have pledged their allegiance to an Order can enter, making it a highly social and competitive dungeon that fosters a sense of community and 
loyalty. The Dungeon of Guilds contains unique challenges that scale depending on the guild's rank and achievements, offering valuable rewards for those who 
succeed.

	Social Aspects and Progression

- Group Dynamics : Dungeons in World Game emphasize the importance of teamwork and group coordination. Parties must work together to overcome elite mobs, difficult boss encounters, and complex mechanics that demand strategic thinking and synergy.

- Achievements and Leaderboards : Many dungeons offer achievements for completing specific challenges, such as clearing the dungeon under a time limit or without taking damage. Leaderboards track players' success in dungeons, adding a competitive element to the game. Seasonal rewards might also be tied to dungeon completion, incentivizing players to tackle dungeons regularly and at different difficulty levels.

- Farming Dungeons : Many players return to dungeons regularly to farm loot, experience, and gear. Farming dungeons is essential for acquiring entry-level gear for higher difficulty instances and raids. The loot from dungeons often forms the foundation for a character’s progression, making these areas crucial for gearing up and tackling endgame content.

		Dungeon Diversity Across Regions

	Each region in the World Game offers unique dungeons, often corresponding to the region's level range and themes. As players progress through the game, they 
will encounter dungeons that reflect the diverse environments of the world, each with its own set of challenges and rewards. For example, dungeons in the Outland 
Territories offer a higher level of difficulty and improved loot compared to those in the starting continent.

- Dungeons by Region : Every region has at least one dungeon where players are encouraged to focus their attention. The second region onward features a similar number of dungeons, with some culminating in a challenging "Instance" that tests players with more difficult mechanics and stronger bosses.
