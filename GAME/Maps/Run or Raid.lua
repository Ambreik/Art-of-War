			Raid or Run

	A "Run" is a gameplay mode similar to a dungeon, but with mechanics like those found in instances. The monsters in Runs are usually "Rank III" or higher, and 
the objective is to defeat a leader, boss, or a group of several bosses, with one of them typically located at the end of the Run. This mission is timed, and if not 
completed within the given timeframe by the system, it fails.

	Characteristics of Runs:
- "Location" : Runs are typically located in places like towers, labyrinths, parts of castles, or even inside dungeons.
- "Timed Challenges" : While not necessarily timed for the entire mission, some sections or floors of the Run are time-limited.Time management is critical to succeed.
- "Difficulty" : These Runs are designed for small groups, but experienced players can also attempt them solo if they have the proper equipment, level, and knowledge of the monstersâ€™ tactics. Players need to develop strategies to overcome the challenges within the Run.

- "Guarded Entrances" : The entrances to Runs are always protected by guards, who will require the player to either complete a mission, provide a key, or perform some
other favor before granting access to the Run.

	Limits:
- "Cooldown" : After completing a Run, a cooldown of 1 hour is applied to the entire account for that specific Run location. This prevents players from repeatedly
farming the same Run in a short period.
- "Daily Limit" : Players can complete each Run up to 3 times per day, with a few exceptions. This limit resets at midnight server time.
