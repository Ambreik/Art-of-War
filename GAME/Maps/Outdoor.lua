			Outdoor

		What is "Outdoors"?
	In "World Game", "Outdoors" refers to areas that are part of the overworld map, such as open landscapes, and the streets of capital cities. An area is either 
classified as "outdoors" or it is not, based on its design. This classification plays a significant role in determining which abilities and items can be used.

		Why is it Important?
	The outdoors classification is crucial for managing which abilities can be used. Specifically, certain abilities can only be used outdoors. Since most major 
instances, boss fights, and dungeons are classified as **indoors**, this limitation restricts the effectiveness of certain abilities in those scenarios.

		Exceptions
	Some locations, while technically part of the overworld, do not count as "outdoors" for specific gameplay mechanics. These include:

- "Major Cities" : These are considered "indoor" areas but only prevent "PvP Stance" in specific locations (e.g., central places or areas near NPCs).
- "Wild Buildings" : Buildings found in wilderness areas are classified as "indoor" and restrict certain abilities, such as teleportation items or spells.
- "Dark Temple" : Considered "indoor" despite being part of the outdoors.
- "Minotaur Maze" : Considered "indoor" for similar reasons.
- "Market Plaza" : Also considered "indoor."

		Affected Abilities
	The following abilities and items can only be used "outdoors" :

- "Mounts", particularly "Flying Mounts".
- "Guardian/Baron" abilities.
- "Travel Forms" in certain locations.
- "PvP Stance".
- Certain **Items** (e.g., "Engagement Ring").
