			Indoor

	What is "Indoors"?  
"Indoor" is a feature of particular areas within the "World Game." It is a binary classification, meaning an area is either considered "indoors" or it is not. This 
classification is used to determine the usage of certain abilities. With a few noteworthy exceptions, any area that is clearly not part of the open world map and 
requires a portal or a door to travel inside is considered "Indoor."

	"Ghost Ship" Travel is also considered "Indoor," but players can use a flying mount to flee or jump off the ship, with some consequences.  
	"Guild Maps" are also considered "Indoor," but "PvP Stance" is only permitted if an enemy finds a way to enter.

	Why is it Important?  
	This classification is important as it affects the usage of certain abilities which "Can only be used outdoors." Since all instances and dungeons are "indoors," 
this greatly reduces the group utility of abilities with that restriction. Additionally, "Runs," being part of a "Dungeon," are also included here.

		Affected abilities  
	The following abilities can only be used outdoors:
- All teleportation items are forbidden.
- All teleportation spells or skills are forbidden.
- All "Flying Mounts" are forbidden.
- All "Aquatic Mounts" are forbidden.
- Guardian/Baron forbidden.
- In some locations, "Travel Form" is forbidden.
- Transformation passive in some locations is forbidden.
- In most "Indoor" locations, "PvP Stance" is forbidden.
