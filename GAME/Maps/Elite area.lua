			Elite area

	Elite areas (aka non-instanced dungeons, micro dungeons, and half dungeons) are areas in a non-instanced zone, usually outdoor, full of elite creatures. These 
areas typically require a group to complete and are often the focus of group quests.

	In the "Outland Territories," most regions have an elite area where elite mobs roam, often near points of interest such as "Taverns" or entrances to dungeons, 
caves, or runs.
