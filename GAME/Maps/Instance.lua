			Instance

	Major hostile areas like dungeons, keeps, and other confined areas can have sub-areas called instances (also known as instance(d) dungeons). These instances are
special areas in the World Game where your group or raid party can interact with a dungeon privately, without interference from other parties or raids. It also 
serves as a respite from the global PvP environment. The term "instance" is often used interchangeably with the term "dungeon."
	Instance dungeons tend to feature the most difficult and rewarding content, both in terms of enemies and items, as well as level design. Most mobs inside the 
instance are elite, with the exception of some mobs, and they perform well above their level. Instances usually feature multiple bosses, each with special abilities
and immunities. Getting through an instance normally requires a well-trained and well-balanced group of players who are of an appropriate level for the challenge.
	Lower-level instances can be soloed by a higher-level character. While it may be an interesting challenge, the drops will not be particularly useful anymore 
except for selling or trading to low-level players who have enough gold).

		Farming for Gear
	Instances are often farmed for gear by having a high-level character take a low-level character through the instance, either as a friend or for a fee. Boss 
drops are typically BoP (Bind on Pickup), so the low-level character must be present.
	The lower character will gain a lot of XP in the instance. If building a "twink," you will need to plan for this; start farming as soon as you're able, and be 
selective about which instances you farm. XP is not your friend in this case (since it levels you up); you want as little as possible to keep farming at your target
level. Focus on specific gear and bypass unnecessary kills.

		Game Mechanics
	Since instances are separate from the actual main World Game maps, such as the Outland Territories, players are literally moved from one part of the map to an 
artificial version of the main map sections.

		Instance Locks
	Once you kill a boss in an instance, you receive an instance lock with respect to that boss. While the instance lock is in place, you can't enter any copy of
the instance where that boss is alive, nor can you queue for it in the Dungeon Finder. The instance itself resets after a minimum of 3 hours, up to one day, 
depending on the instance and location. The higher the location, the longer the wait for a reset. Special items or favors from Instance Keepers (when you have 
maximum reputation with them) can also be used to reset the instance. Instance locks reset at midnight server time every morning by default.

		Limits
	A player can only enter three individual instances in one hour. This applies even if the player uses the instance reset multiple times within that hour, as each
reset is considered a separate instance. This rule applies across all characters on an account, so logging into a different character and trying to enter the same 
instance will result in the same message. The intention is to limit, but not stop, instance farming. However, you can still queue for random instances in the 
Dungeon Finder while under this limit.
	Additionally, if a character is 10 levels higher than the highest monster level in a specific instance, they cannot enter the instance due to the large 
discrepancy between their level and the monstersâ€™ levels. This rule applies to any chapter in the Game World, except when the character reaches level 120, at which 
point they can enter all instances from both the "Outland Territories" and the "Legrand" continent.
