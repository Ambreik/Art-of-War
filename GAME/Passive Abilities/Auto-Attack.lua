			Auto-Attack
			
	An auto-attack or autoattack is any kind of player or pet attack that will repeat automatically unless interrupted by the player or some other event. Auto-attacks 
function separately to the use of specific abilities, and do not interrupt or affect their use. Auto-attack automatically uses the player's current target, and lasts 
until cancelled.
	Auto-attacks have an internal swing or cast timer which, while not displayed to the player, determines how regularly attacks are made. This is generally affected 
by haste. If the target moves out of range of auto-attack, auto-attacks will cease. Once the target is once more in range, or a new target is selected, auto-attacks 
will automatically resume. Auto-attack will be suspended by crowd control effects such as stuns and fears, but will resume once the effect has ended.
	
	Auto-attack damage is improved by numerous passives or skills that improve attack speed or different potions and food that increase it.
	
		Melee
	Auto-attacks are a substantial source of damage generation for melee classes, and serve to generate rage for most of the classes, mana Enhancement for warlocks and
shamans but also powerfull for "Vampire" class that generate fast "Blood Orbs" to enchant their attacks. They can also proc certain passive abilities, and interact 
with all abilities that affect melee attacks.
	Melee auto-attacks serve to deal a steady, reliable flow of damage while the player focuses on more specific ability usage. 
	Using a hostile melee ability or specifically melee attacking a target will initiate auto-attack by the player.

		Ranged
	Normal ranged and thrown weapon attacks do not use auto-attack. Hunters need to use the  [Auto Shot] ability to make their ranged attacks repeat automatically.
	Normal ranged attacks for Archers are focusing only for a specific target that is under player level by default. In order to make use of system Auto-Attack, have 
to learn the passive skill with the same name first doing small quests in main city starting with level 14 from Archer Master or Archer Teacher.
