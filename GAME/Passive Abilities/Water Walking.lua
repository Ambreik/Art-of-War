			Water Walking

	"Water Walking" is a passive spell that gives a buff to targets which allows them to walk on water. A player under the effects of "Water Walking" can still dive 
under water if they choose, and doing so will not cancel the buff.
	This passive spell works only over water that is not deep enough to cover the entire body of target if is going under water. Once the water deepest point reach the
height of the target, target suddently drown disappearing from sight.
	This passive spell is disabled if a breeding underwater passive or item is used before or after.
	
		Notes
	Any damage taken will cancel the effect. Jumping into water from high enough that you would take fall damage if you were on land while "Water Walking" is activated 
causes you to take damage. This damage can kill you, as the water surface is considered to be ground while "Water Walking" is active. In order to avoid the damage you 
can aim your mouse down towards the water and hold down the right mouse button, and you will fall into the water.
