			Equipment
			
	Equipment refers to any item that can be equipped in an equipment slot, as distinguished from items that can only be carried in inventory.


		Item quality
	Items are ranked by their quality in "World Game", identifiable by the color of the item's name. For non-equippable items, the colors are the same. Gray named 
items that you can't equip generally have no use in the game, and should just be sold to vendors for cash.
