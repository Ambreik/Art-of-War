	Armor Types
Body Armor and Shields come in three weight Types: Light, Medium, and Heavy. See individual item pages to see the type; Exceptional and Elite equivalents have same types.

*Light armor has no negative influence on a character's speed. Generally, this consists of leather and lightweight metal armor and small or non-metal shields, as well as all Paladin Shields.
*Medium armor will decrease a character's Run/Walk by -0.3 y/s (5% of walk speed) and Charge by -0.7 y/s. This generally consists of mail and light plate armor and large wooden and metal shields. Medium body armor will also increase stamina consumption by 50%, while Medium Shields do not have this effect.[3]
*Heavy armor will decrease a character's Run/Walk by -0.6 y/s (10% of walk speed) and Charge by -1.5 y/s. This generally consists of heavier mail and plate armor and Tower Shield and its equivalents. Heavy body armor will also increase stamina consumption by 100%, while Heavy Shields do not have this effect.
