			Reputation System

		1. Reputation System Overview

	The "Reputation System" tracks a player relationship with specific NPCs, factions, or groups and determines how much "trust" they have earned. As players 
interact with NPCs, complete quests, make choices, and participate in world events, their "reputation" with these entities will evolve. This system is divided into 
different layers:

1. "NPC Trust Reputation" : Tracks how much an NPC trusts the player, based on actions, quests, and dialogue choices.
2. "Faction Reputation" : Measures the player’s standing within specific factions or groups, which can influence their access to faction-specific content, quests, 
and rewards.
3. "World Progression Reputation" : A broader reputation system that reflects how the player’s choices influence the story and the game world, unlocking major plot 
points or affecting the world’s balance (e.g., positive or negative impact on the faction’s power).

		2. Reputation System Structure

	Trust Reputation with NPCs

- "Trust Levels" : The trust between the player and an NPC can be broken down into different levels. As the player progresses, they unlock more services, quests, and personal interactions with the NPC.

  1. "Neutral" : Default state. The NPC has no strong opinion of the player. The player may still interact with the NPC, but no special perks are unlocked.
	- Actions : General dialogue and basic quests.
  
  2. "Friendly" : The NPC sees the player as a reliable ally. The player can access some basic special services, discounts, or minor rewards.
	- Actions : Completing easy quests, assisting in basic tasks, or making the right choices in dialogues.

  3. "Ally" : The NPC deeply trusts the player, offering them access to exclusive quests, unique items, and temporary combat assistance.
	- Actions : Helping the NPC in major personal quests, siding with them in important decisions.

  4. "Trusted" : The NPC treats the player as a close confidant, unlocking major storylines, valuable rewards, or even the ability to recruit them for personal combat/assistance.
     - Actions : Completing difficult quests, showing consistency in moral alignment, and making impactful decisions.

  5. "Exemplary" : The NPC considers the player as their greatest ally and offers powerful rewards, rare items, or even long-term buffs to the player.
     - Actions : Completing highly challenging, reputation-building quests or making heroic, world-changing decisions.

- "Trust Reputation Adjustments" :
  - Completing specific quests related to an NPC or their faction (either main storyline or side quests) will affect the reputation with that NPC.
  - Dialogue choices will also play a major role. For example, offering help, agreeing with their viewpoint, or defending them in certain situations can all improve
trust, while failing to deliver on promises or taking opposing actions will lower it.
  - Events : Participating in "world events", saving NPCs in battle, or assisting with their personal problems will contribute to building trust.

		Faction Reputation

- "Faction Trust Levels" : Each faction or group the player interacts with will have its own "Reputation Level". Factions may range from benevolent groups (e.g., guilds, friendly factions) to darker ones (e.g., enemy factions, criminal syndicates). Reputation with factions will affect access to faction-exclusive content, 
such as quests, recipes, or even factions' help during major story moments.

  1. "Neutral" : The player is neither a threat nor a help to the faction.
  2. "Friendly" : The faction is beginning to favor the player, granting access to some quests and minor rewards.
  3. "Ally" : The player is highly regarded, unlocking exclusive faction content (e.g., items, special quests).
  4. "Honored" : The faction sees the player as a true ally, potentially offering powerful support or special recognition.
  5. "Exalted" : The player is revered, and the faction may assist them in key battles, offer legendary rewards, or provide them with the highest-tier content 
available.

- "Faction Reputation Adjustments" :
  - Completing "faction-specific quests" or "main storyline quests" that favor a particular faction will positively influence this reputation.
  - Decisions in key story moments that affect the faction’s goals or enemies will have lasting impacts on this reputation. Players may choose to support, betray, 
or work with rival factions.
  - Faction-related actions, such as "combat support" in faction wars or helping them defend their territory, will improve reputation. On the other hand, betraying 
or failing their quests will lower the reputation.

	World Progression Reputation

- This reputation system tracks the broader consequences of the player’s actions within the world and can influence how NPCs, factions, and even the game’s storyline progress.

  1. "Neutral" : The player’s actions haven’t yet impacted the world on a large scale.
  2. "Heroic" : The player’s actions are recognized as heroic by the world, influencing how NPCs treat them (e.g., more trust from NPCs, better treatment in cities, positive event outcomes).
  3. "Legendary" : The player’s actions are immortalized, and their name is known across the world. This affects how factions and NPCs interact with them.
  4. "Doomed" : If the player makes destructive decisions, they may face a dark reputation that locks certain factions out or leads to global consequences.

- World Progression Reputation Adjustments :
  - Major story decisions and branching questlines directly influence world reputation.
  - Faction wars or large-scale conflicts may shift the balance of power, requiring players to choose sides or take actions that will shape the fate of the world.
  - Endgame content or global story arcs where the player’s allegiance, choices, or actions lead to a wide-reaching impact.

		3. Reputation-Related Rewards and Effects

	As players progress through the reputation system,NPCs,factions,and the game world will provide tangible rewards and effects based on their "Trust Reputation" :

- "Access to Exclusive Quests" : Higher trust levels with NPCs unlock more detailed and complex questlines.
- "Special Items and Gear" : NPCs and factions may provide unique items or gear, including "Legendary Gear" and "Faction-Specific Items".
- "Combat Assistance" : NPCs with high trust can join the player in combat or provide buffs to help with tougher challenges.
- "Story Progression" : High reputation levels unlock critical storyline events that may differ based on the player’s interactions with NPCs, factions, and the 
world.
- "Influence on the Game World" : Major choices tied to reputation can alter the world around the player, such as how factions act toward the player or changes in 
the environment due to past actions.

		4. Reputation Decay or Reset Mechanism**

	To add further depth and challenge to the system, could be introduced "reputation decay" or "reputation resets" :
- "Decay" : If a player stops interacting with a faction or NPC for a long time, their reputation may naturally decline, pushing them to stay engaged with factions 
and NPCs to maintain their trust.
- "Reset Mechanism" : If a player makes significant negative choices (e.g., betraying a faction),their reputation could be reset or severely damaged. In some cases,
they may need to go through redemption quests to restore trust.

		5. Reputation Tracking System

	The "Reputation UI" can show the player’s standing with key NPCs, factions, and world events, including:
- "Reputation Bar" : For each NPC or faction, a reputation bar showing current standing and what is required to increase the trust level.
- "Current and Future Rewards" : Displaying the rewards that become available at each trust level (items, quests, story events).
- "Dialogue Cues" : NPCs will react differently depending on the player's trust level, offering new dialogue options based on reputation.
