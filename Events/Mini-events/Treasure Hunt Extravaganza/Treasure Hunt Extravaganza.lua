			Treasure Hunt Extravaganza  

	Started by : Captain Oswin Drake  
	Location : Various locations across "Sunnymean Island" and scattered shores.

		Event Overview :   
	The "Treasure Hunt Extravaganza" is an island-wide, seasonal event orchestrated by "Captain Oswin Drake", designed to test players' wits, bravery, and 
resourcefulness. It takes place once a year, typically during the spring season, and is heralded as the most anticipated event on "Sunnymean Island". The hunt is 
rumored to follow a secret set of ancient pirate maps—maps that lead to hidden treasures scattered across the island and beneath the surrounding waters. This 
treasure hunt is not just about the riches—it’s about glory, solving puzzles, and uncovering the island's deep, forgotten history. 

		Event Description :   
	The event begins when "Captain Oswin Drake" invites adventurers to partake in the grand hunt by gathering at his base of operations—a weathered, yet stately
"Pirate’s Cove", located on the northern coast of "Sunnymean Island". Here, players will receive their first clue, setting them off on a sprawling journey across 
the island. The clues themselves are riddles and puzzles with cryptic references to well-known landmarks on the island, making navigation as much a part of the 
challenge as the treasure itself.

		Phase 1: The Hunt Begins  
	At the start of the event, "Captain Oswin Drake" will announce the beginning of the treasure hunt via a booming cannon shot, signaling players to begin. 
Players are given a starting clue (for example: "Where the sun kisses the ocean, find what you seek"), and they must follow this riddle to the first location. Each 
riddle is linked to a physical location in the game world—such as the "Sandy Shores ", "Sunken Wreck of the “Iron Gull”", or "Eldershade Ruins"—and players must 
explore, interact with NPCs, or complete environmental puzzles to find the next clue hidden within these areas.  

		Clues for the Treasure Hunt  
	Captain Oswin Drake will provide progressive clues, leading players from one location to the next. Each clue is tied to local landmarks, existing NPCs, and 
interactive elements within the world.  

1. First Clue (Starting Location: South Ram Port)  
   - "Where golden grains meet the sea’s embrace, the journey begins in a peaceful place."  
   - Hint : Directs players to "Sandy Shores", where shells and artifacts are often found.  

2. Second Clue (Found at Sandy Shores)  
   - "Beneath the waves, where sailors weep, the Iron Gull lies in eternal sleep."  
   - Hint : Leads players to the "Sunken Wreck of the “Iron Gull”", an underwater shipwreck site.  

3. Third Clue (Found at the Sunken Wreck)  
   - "Ancient stones, where whispers fade, a path unknown lies in Eldershade."  
   - Hint : Guides players to "Eldershade Ruins", a historic location on the island.  

4. Final Clue (Found at Eldershade Ruins)
   - "Under roots where shadows creep, the final prize is buried deep."  
   - Hint : Directs players to an unmarked burial spot hidden within Eldershade Ruins, where the treasure awaits.  


		Phase 2: The Rivals and Obstacles  
	As players progress, they will be up against more than just the clock. Rival adventurers (controlled by AI or competing players) also seek the treasure and may 
steal clues, sabotage efforts, or even set traps to hinder the progress of others. NPCs from rival pirate factions may also interfere with the hunt, attempting to 
mislead players or create false clues to disrupt progress. These enemies provide the danger element, and players must choose when to fight, negotiate, or outsmart 
their rivals.

	Additionally, dangerous environmental obstacles present themselves. From swampy bogs that slow players down, to flooded caves requiring specialized equipment to
traverse, these challenges force adventurers to think creatively or work together. Only those who can maintain the balance between speed, intellect, and caution 
will make it to the final location.

		Phase 2a : The Rivals and Obstacles (Expanded Details)  

	As players progress deeper into the treasure hunt, the challenge increases. Time is no longer the only enemy—other treasure seekers, both AI-controlled rival 
adventurers and members of pirate factions, actively attempt to disrupt and mislead players in the hunt.

	Rival Adventurers (AI-Controlled Competitors & PvP Elements)  
	
	These are elite treasure hunters, each with unique backgrounds and motivations. Some are part of wealthy explorer guilds, while others are lone rogues looking 
to claim the treasure for themselves.  

	Ways Rival Adventurers Sabotage Players :  
1. Stealing Clues – If a player reaches a riddle location but lingers too long, an NPC rival might grab the clue first and disappear, forcing players to either 
track them down or solve the puzzle another way.  
2. Placing False Clues – Some rivals will drop fake clues, leading players to dead ends or dangerous locations filled with hostile creatures.  
3. Setting Traps – Rival adventurers may set traps along jungle pathways, near ruins, or within shipwreck debris, triggering hazards like:  
	- Falling Logs – Blocks paths, forcing detours.  
	- Tripwires – Summons hostile animals or alerts pirates.  
	- Poison Darts – Inflicts "Delirium", causing the player’s compass to spin wildly for 2 minutes.  
4. Hiring Mercenaries – Some rival NPCs, especially high-level ones, may bribe local thugs or mercenaries to ambush players en route to the next clue.  
5. PvP Interference (If Enabled) – In PvP servers, players can form groups to ambush or steal quest progress from others, leading to heated rivalries.  

---

	Pirate Faction Interference (Misleading & Combat Challenges)
	
	Not everyone wants treasure seekers uncovering hidden wealth. The pirates of the Sunken Wreck of the "Iron Gull" see the treasure as rightfully theirs and will 
do everything possible to mislead players.  

	Pirate Sabotage Methods :  
1. False NPC Informants – Some pirates disguise themselves as helpful NPCs, giving incorrect riddle solutions to send players to monster-infested areas.  
2. Planted Treasure Maps – Players might find forged maps that lead them into ambushes rather than real treasure.  
3. Disguised Pirates – Some pirates pose as fellow adventurers and can suddenly attack when players lower their guard.  
4. Naval Raids on the Shoreline – If players approach coastal locations, pirate ships may fire cannons at them, forcing quick dodging or an alternate route.
5. Threats & Bribery – Players may be given the option to bribe pirates for safe passage, but if they refuse, they risk attacks from hidden pirate camps.

	Strategies for Players to Counter Rivals & Pirates :  
- Forming Groups – Teams have an advantage over solo players when dealing with rival adventurers or pirate threats.  
- Investing in Reputation with Captain Oswin Drake – Higher reputation with the "South Ram Port authorities" provides warnings about pirate activity and secret 
escape routes.  
- Using Tracking Skills – Some classes (e.g., Rogues, Rangers) can track rival adventurers' footprints, making it easier to follow those who stole clues.  
- Interrogating Captured Pirates – Instead of outright killing enemies, players can interrogate captured pirates for information on real treasure locations vs. 
decoys.  

	With this, Phase 2 becomes an unpredictable mix of strategy, deception, and danger, forcing players to be cautious while progressing toward the ultimate prize.

		Phase 3: Uncovering the Treasure  
	The final clue, however, is the ultimate test. It will lead players to a remote, hidden cavern on "Sunnymean Island", accessible only by traversing difficult 
terrain or solving a difficult puzzle with the help of NPCs. The entrance is guarded by ancient mechanisms, requiring players to collect hidden keys or artifacts in
the previous phases. 

	Once inside, players must navigate through perilous traps, including poison darts, collapsing floors, and aggressive wildlife. The treasure is located deep 
within a large treasure chamber, surrounded by ancient pirate markings and a treasure hoard of gold, jewels, and artifacts.
	But there is a twist: the treasure chest is locked with a final, intricate puzzle or requires players to engage in a combat encounter with a mythical creature 
(such as a "Pirate Ghost Captain" or a "Sea Serpent") that guards the treasure. Defeating or outsmarting this creature is the final step before claiming the 
treasure.

		Phase 3a: Uncovering the Treasure (Expanded Details) 


	NPC Assistance and Support in Phase 3  

	Several NPCs can assist players in reaching and solving the final puzzle, either by providing key information, special tools, or guidance on mythical creatures.

	NPCs That Provide Help :  
1. Captain Oswin Drake (South Ram Port, Harbor) → Offers insight into ancient pirate lore and hints about the treasure cave’s location.  
2. Kaelen Brightsong (Tavern at South Ram Port) → Provides riddles about the treasure’s history, guiding players to needed keys or artifacts.  
3. Sergeant Edwin Thornwall (South Ram Port Guardian Captain) → Offers maps of old pirate routes, revealing alternative paths to the hidden cavern.  
4. Elias “Eli” Buckler (Smuggler NPC, South Ram Port) → Can smuggle players past obstacles if they have ties to the Smuggler Faction.  
5. Gryveer Tall (Gryveer Field) → Knows about the island’s terrain and can provide safe passage routes through dangerous wildlife zones.  
6. Unnamed NPC (Future Location) (Historian or Scholar NPC from another area, will be developed later) → Provides direct knowledge about the treasure guardian's 
weaknesses.

	The Mythical Guardians of the Treasure  

	Players must defeat or outsmart one of two possible treasure guardians to claim the treasure hoard.  

	
		1. Pirate Ghost Captain – "Captain Dreadwake"
		
	Appearance :  
- A skeletal, ethereal pirate wreathed in ghostly mist, dressed in a tattered admiral’s coat, with glowing blue spectral eyes.  
- Wields a cursed cutlass and a rusted flintlock pistol, both imbued with ghostly magic.  

	Mechanics of Engagement :  
- Cannot be harmed by normal weapons unless infused with "Spectral Oil" (acquired from Elias Buckler).  
- Can be exorcised using a sacred relic found in previous puzzle segments.  
- Players can choose to fight or parley with Dreadwake, convincing him to allow them access.  

	Skills Used :  
1. Ghostly Slash – A spectral sword strike that bypasses armor, dealing pure shadow damage.  
2. Cursed Pistol Shot – Inflicts "Spectral Wound", a DOT effect reducing health regeneration.  
3. Summon Phantom Crew – Calls ghostly pirate minions that distract and swarm players.  
4. Undying Resolve – If reduced below 10% HP, Dreadwake enters an invulnerable state, forcing players to find a hidden relic in the room to banish him permanently.

	How to Outsmart Dreadwake :  
- If players have high reputation with Captain Oswin, they can use an old pirate code to make a wager, winning the treasure without fighting.  
- Using a sacred relic or enchanted rum, they can lull him into a deep slumber, bypassing combat altogether.  

		2. The Sea Serpent – "Leviathan of the Deep"  
	Appearance :  
- A massive, scaly serpent with glowing blue bioluminescent patterns along its body.  
- Has four glowing eyes and a spiny, armored hide, making it resistant to most weapons.  

	Mechanics of Engagement :  
- Fights in a partially submerged chamber, forcing players to fight on unstable stone platforms.  
- Cannot be directly damaged until its protective scales are softened by fire or magical attacks.  
- Has a weak point behind its gills, only exposed when it lunges forward.  

	Skills Used :  
1. Tidal Wave – Floods part of the room, sweeping away unprepared players.  
2. Whirlpool Snare – Creates a whirlpool trap that immobilizes players, forcing them to rely on teammates.  
3. Venomous Spit – Launches toxic bile that lowers vision and attack speed.  
4. Death Coil – If left unchecked, Leviathan will wrap around the entire chamber, squeezing players and causing an area-wide damage-over-time effect.  

	How to Outsmart the Leviathan :  
- Players can use fire-based attacks or specialized weapons from Alva Mornleaf’s farming store to weaken its scales before engaging.  
- Luring it into collapsing parts of the cavern ceiling stuns it, allowing access to the treasure without direct combat.  

---

	Treasure Chamber Access & Time Limit  
- Once a player or group unlocks the treasure chamber, it becomes inaccessible to others for 30 minutes.  
- Players must claim the treasure before the timer runs out, or they will be forcefully ejected from the chamber.  
- If a player fails, the entrance reseals and they must redo the previous phases to gain access again.

	With this, Phase 3 becomes an intense combination of puzzle-solving, combat, and strategy, ensuring a rewarding yet challenging experience for treasure hunters.

		Rewards and Achievements
		
	The "Treasure Hunt Extravaganza" is designed to be both a grand adventure and a rewarding experience. 
	The main treasure chest contains the "Golden Pirate’s Bounty", a unique set of high-value items including:

- Gold Coins : A large sum of currency.
- Legendary Items : High-level, event-exclusive gear or weapons with special properties.
- Treasure Maps : Additional quests that lead to hidden caches of even more riches.
- Treasure Hunter’s Badge : An event achievement, granting access to exclusive areas or quests tied to Captain Oswin Drake’s pirate crew.

	The player or group that locates the treasure first is hailed as the "Champion of the Treasure Hunt", receiving the "Golden Pirate’s Medallion", a rare item 
	that grants increased reputation with "Captain Oswin Drake" and his pirate faction. Players also gain exclusive items, such as:

- Pirate’s Compass : A magical item that helps locate hidden items and treasure spots across the world.

	Additional Mechanics

the players' discretion, and combat with NPC enemies will not flag players for PvP.

unveiling of the treasure, and any remaining unclaimed treasures are either redistributed or become inaccessible until the next year.
- Team Play : Although the event can be tackled solo, teams of players are encouraged to cooperate, with benefits for teamwork, such as faster puzzle solving or 
combat assistance.
- NPC Interactions : Throughout the event, players will interact with NPCs—some friendly, some hostile—that provide clues, items, or distractions. Some NPCs may 
require players to perform side quests to unlock clues, adding layers of complexity.

	Key Event NPCs  
- Captain Oswin Drake : The event organizer and quest giver. He remains at "Pirate's Cove", giving out the first clue and overseeing the event.
- Rival Pirate Leaders : AI-controlled NPCs that compete in the treasure hunt. They occasionally appear at key points, offering false information, creating 
distractions, or ambushing players to steal clues.
- Mysterious Merchant : A traveling NPC who appears during the event, offering rare items that help players solve puzzles or complete the hunt faster.

		Event Narrative  
	The narrative of the event revolves around uncovering the mystery of the island’s pirate past, where legends speak of a buried treasure belonging to a long-lost
pirate king. The event also ties into the larger story of "Captain Oswin Drake", a former pirate who is now seeking to pass down the pirate legacy to worthy 
adventurers. Along the way, players learn more about the history of "Sunnymean Island", its past inhabitants, and the ancient pirate clan that once ruled the seas.
