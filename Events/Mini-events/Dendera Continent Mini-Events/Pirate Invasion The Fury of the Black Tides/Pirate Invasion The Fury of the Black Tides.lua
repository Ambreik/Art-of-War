			Pirate Invasion - The Fury of the Black Tides  

	Started by Captain Oswin Drake & Sergeant Edwin Thornwall  
	Location South Ram Port & Surrounding Coastal Waters  
	Event Type Dynamic World Event (PvE & PvP)  

---

	Event Overview : The Pirate Invasion - The Fury of the Black Tides is a large-scale island defense event that occurs when the dreaded Black Tide Fleet, a 
notorious pirate faction, attempts a full-scale assault on South Ram Port. These vicious marauders aim to plunder the harbor, burn down critical structures, and 
seize control of the trade routes, throwing the entire island into chaos.  

	The event is triggered randomly every 3 to 5 in-game weeks, but the intensity and scale of the invasion depend on Captain Oswin Drake's reputation system—if 
players have built strong defenses and kept pirate activity low, the attack will be minor, but if pirate influence has grown unchecked, the battle will escalate 
into a full-scale war.
	
	This event involves several phases, dynamic enemy waves, boss encounters, and unique rewards for both PvE defenders and PvP opportunists. The port must be 
defended from destruction, or else players will suffer severe economic penalties, including higher merchant prices, restricted boat travel, and access to certain 
quests being locked for days.

		Event Phases  
	The event consists of four escalating phases, where players must react to evolving threats in real time.

---

	Phase 1 The Black Tide Rises (Initial Raid - 10 min)  
- The Black Tide Fleet approaches South Ram Port from the eastern waters.  
- A fleet of 5-7 pirate ships drops anchor near the coast, launching rowboats filled with pirate raiders.  
- Captain Oswin Drake sounds the alarm, and Sergeant Edwin Thornwall starts rallying NPC guards while calling players to assist in the defense.  
- Pirates land on the beaches and docks, attacking villagers, merchants, and supply warehouses.  
- Objectives  
	- Defend Marla Fenwick’s shop (General Merchant).  
	- Protect the Boat Rental NPC (Harlan Tidechaser)—if he dies, boats will be unrentable for 3 hours.  
	- Kill Pirate Saboteurs attempting to set fire to supply crates.  

	Dynamic Factors  
- If the dock guards are killed, pirates establish a foothold, making later phases more difficult.  
- If players prevent sabotage, supplies remain intact, reducing repair costs later.  

---

	Phase 2 The Siege of South Ram Port (Major Assault - 15 min)  
- The pirates overwhelm the harbor, bringing in heavily armed raiders, including berserkers, ranged gunners, and assassins.  
- Cannons from the pirate ships begin bombarding the port, dealing area-wide damage.  
- Sergeant Edwin Thornwall leads NPC defenders into battle, fighting alongside players.  
- Pirate Captains emerge, commanding squads of elite fighters.  
- Civilians attempt to flee, and some must be escorted to safety.  
- Pirates begin seizing control points, like the Tavern and the Warehouse District.  

Objectives  
- Defeat the Pirate Captains before they secure the port.  
- Destroy the pirate cannons bombarding the town.  
- Protect Sergeant Edwin Thornwall—if he falls, NPC reinforcements will stop spawning.  

Dynamic Factors  
- If pirates take the Tavern, Elias “Eli” Buckler (Smuggler Contact) becomes active, allowing criminal-aligned players to switch sides and support the pirates.  
- If Harlan Tidechaser is dead from Phase 1, pirates loot all boats, delaying sea travel for all players for 6 hours.

	Phase 3 The Flagship Duel (Boss Encounter - 20 min)  
- With pirate forces weakened, the Black Tide Admiral—a legendary boss enemy—arrives aboard his massive flagship, The Crimson Reaver.  
- The Admiral taunts the defenders, demanding the surrender of Captain Oswin Drake in exchange for sparing the town.  
- Oswin refuses, launching a counteroffensive—he boards the enemy flagship, and players can join him in the final battle.  
- The Admiral fights using dual cutlasses and cursed voodoo magic, making him a challenging, multi-phase boss fight.  
- The flagship is on fire, and players must navigate burning decks, enemy crew, and cannon barrages while battling.  

Objectives  
- Defeat the Black Tide Admiral in combat.  
- Destroy the enemy ship’s powder kegs to sink the flagship.  
- If Oswin is defeated, the event fails, and pirates take over the port until an NPC-led rebellion drives them out.  

Dynamic Factors  
- If players win, the Admiral retreats, swearing revenge, and pirate attacks lessen for several weeks.  
- If players lose, the port falls, causing increased merchant prices and restricted quests.  

	Phase 3a: The Flagship Duel (Boss Encounter - 20 min)  

	Overview : The final phase of the event sees the legendary "Black Tide Admiral", a formidable and infamous pirate, arriving on his enormous flagship, 
"The Crimson Reaver". With his forces weakened, the Admiral challenges the defenders of South Ram Port, taunting them and demanding the surrender of 
"Captain Oswin Drake". Oswin, however, refuses to bow to the Admiral’s demands, rallying the players for one final, epic showdown aboard the flagship. Players can 
board The Crimson Reaver alongside Oswin and engage the Black Tide Admiral in an intense, multi-phase boss fight that will test their combat skills, coordination, 
and ability to survive the chaos of battle.

	Boss Name : Black Tide Admiral Aslan "The Dread" Kane

- 	Appearance : Aslan Kane is an imposing figure, standing tall with dark, weathered skin marked by scars from countless battles. His eyes glow with the power of 
ancient cursed magic, and his hair is wild and unkempt, tied back with pirate trinkets. He wears a tattered but regal coat of deep crimson, signifying his command 
over The Crimson Reaver. His dual cutlasses are etched with dark runes, and a cursed, blood-red aura surrounds him, pulsing with the power of his voodoo magic.

the dead. His arrogance and cunning are matched only by his strength in battle. He will mock players during the fight, urging them to surrender or die trying. His 
ultimate goal is not only to destroy the defenders but to claim the port as his own, with the prize of Captain Oswin Drake's head.

	Boss Fight Mechanics  

	Phase 1: The Duel Begins	 (0-50% Health)
- 	Environment :  
  The battle starts on the upper deck of 	The Crimson Reaver	, which is ablaze due to earlier cannon barrages. Players must navigate burning sections of the ship and avoid falling debris, all while engaging with the Admiral’s pirate crew and minions, who attempt to swarm the players.
  
- 	Boss Abilities :
  1. 	Dual Cutlass Slash :  
     The Admiral swings both of his cutlasses in a wide arc, dealing heavy damage to anyone in range. The attack has a 360° AoE and requires players to dodge or block.
  
  2. 	Voodoo Curse (Hex of Dread) :  
     The Admiral casts a curse on a random player, reducing their damage dealt and increasing damage they take for a short duration. This curse spreads to nearby allies if not cleansed within 5 seconds, amplifying its effects.

  3. 	Storm of Blades :  
     The Admiral performs a rapid flurry of strikes, hitting multiple players in a linear direction. This attack deals high damage and can stagger players, forcing them to take cover behind burning structures or cannons to avoid the onslaught.

  4. 	Summon Pirate Phantoms :  
     In the middle of Phase 1, the Admiral summons spectral pirates from the depths to assist him. These ghostly minions deal moderate damage and can slow players down with their attacks, requiring the players to fight them off while keeping an eye on the Admiral.

---

	Phase 2: The Burning Deck	 (50-20% Health)  
- 	Environment :  
  As the Admiral’s health drops, The Crimson Reaver is engulfed in flames. The fire spreads across the deck and into lower levels, forcing players to fight while also dealing with collapsing structures, sudden explosions, and fire hazards. Players must remain on the move, as staying in one spot too long may result in getting trapped or hit by falling debris.

- 	Boss Abilities :
  1. 	Infernal Strike :  
     The Admiral summons a burst of fire around himself, dealing massive damage in a radius. Players must dodge this ability or risk taking catastrophic damage.  
     - 	Dodge Mechanic : A circular area will form under the Admiral, giving players a few seconds to escape before the explosion.

  2. 	Voodoo Tides (Curse of the Drowned) :  
     The Admiral’s cursed magic summons torrents of water to flood parts of the ship, creating slippery, hazardous zones that can slow players or cause them to slip and fall. These zones are temporary but can last long enough to become dangerous for players if they are not avoided.
  
  3. 	Flame-Ravaged Smite :  
     The Admiral smashes the deck with his cutlasses, sending out flame waves in a straight line. The attack damages and knocks back any players caught in the line, creating a need for careful positioning and timing.

  4. 	Tidal Phantom Summon (Ghost Fleet) :  
     The Admiral summons multiple ghostly ships around the deck. These ships periodically launch cannonballs that target random players, dealing heavy damage if not avoided. Players must move quickly between cover to avoid these incoming attacks.

---

	Phase 3: The Dreaded Voodoo Magic (20-0% Health)
- Environment : As the Admiral’s health continues to drop, The Crimson Reaver begins to sink into the sea, and the battle shifts to a more precarious position. The 
deck becomes unstable, and parts of the ship are about to collapse. Fire and water now mix, creating even more hazardous conditions. The fight moves into the lower 
levels, where the Admiral prepares his final cursed ritual.

- Boss Abilities :
  1. Voodoo Resurrection (Ghost of the Black Tide) :  
	As his health nears the final stages, the Admiral summons his own ghostly form to assist him, becoming even more powerful. His attacks become faster and deal 
AoE damage.  
	- Players must focus on dealing with the Admiral and the phantom at the same time, splitting damage and avoiding overlapping attacks.

  2. Cursed Meteor Strike :  
	The Admiral calls down a volley of cursed meteors that land across the deck. These meteors deal massive damage and can ignite the environment, causing an 
explosion that creates lasting fire hazards.

  3. Final Voodoo Curse (Dread’s Embrace) :  
	The Admiral casts a powerful curse that lingers across the battlefield, reducing players’ movement speed and damage dealt. For the duration of this curse, 
players take increased damage from all sources.  
	- Players must work together to cleanse this curse using special Voodoo Talismans found on the deck or use specific skills from NPCs who can neutralize curses.

  4. Doomsday Cutlass Finale :  
	In his last moments, the Admiral channels all of his cursed magic into his dual cutlasses, delivering a devastating attack that creates shockwaves across the 
deck. Players must dodge this final blow or risk being knocked off the ship into the water, where they will be incapacitated and have to rejoin the fight.

---

	Victory Conditions : To win, players must bring the Black Tide Admiral Aslan "The Dread" Kane to 0% health, while navigating the dangerous, ever-changing 
environment of The Crimson Reaver and dealing with his powerful voodoo curses, summoning abilities, and fiery chaos. The fight ends with the Admiral’s death, 
causing a massive explosion as his ship sinks, allowing players to claim their rewards.
