		Event Trigger: The Discovery

	The event is triggered when Magnus Holt, the Port Inspector, uncovers a shipment of illegal goods hidden in the cargo of a trading vessel. He soon discovers 
that this operation is tied to notorious smugglers Ilya Marnov and Kara Lorn, who have been running illicit trade routes through the port. Magnus alerts Adira Pell,
Jarek Watchstone, and the Vygor Port Guard, who begin to tighten security.

	Simultaneously, Ilya and Kara, with the help of their apprentices, attempt to orchestrate a risky escape. Tobin Netswift, while not directly involved, may 
become a key player if the smugglers plan to flee by boat.

	New NPCs (Optional to add later):
- Dorin Slackfoot - Smuggler apprentice (lightfooted, excels at sneaking past guards)
- Leora Skimshaw - Smuggler apprentice (skilled in bribery and subterfuge)

		Event Conditions :

	This event can occur once per week, but only if the following conditions are met:

or the system.
- Magnus Holt's Suspicion : Magnus must find a suspicious shipment or illegal transaction, marking the event as a priority for the authorities. This can occur 
naturally over time or by player actions in the region.

		Event Stages :

1. Stage 1: Discovery and Investigation  
	The authorities have identified a suspicious shipment of illegal goods. Magnus and his team begin conducting investigations, with players potentially assisting 
or hindering their progress.
	- Authorities : Players assisting the authorities investigate storage areas, speak with witnesses, and gather clues.
	- Smugglers : Players on the smuggler side work to cover their tracks, possibly leading to a quick confrontation if spotted.

2. Stage 2: The Great Escape  
	Once the smugglers are identified, they will attempt to flee the port, and the event becomes a race against time.
	- Authorities : Blockading all exits and trying to apprehend smugglers. Guards will actively patrol and search for escape routes.
	- Smugglers : Trying to break free, players may need to sabotage the authorities’ efforts or help the smugglers escape via boats or hidden passages.
	- Boat Escape : If smugglers try to escape by water, Tobin Netswift becomes a key figure. Players on the smuggler side may pay him for safe passage, while those
on the authorities' side might try to intercept boats.
   
3. Stage 3: Confrontation  
	Once the smugglers either attempt their escape or are cornered, the final confrontation will occur.
	- Authorities : Engage in direct combat to subdue smugglers, stop the shipment, and secure the area.
	- Smugglers : Use any means possible to escape, including bribery, fleeing via underground tunnels, or taking hostages to ensure safe passage.
	- Neutral Players : Players can decide to shift alliances mid-event, helping either the authorities or the smugglers, depending on how the situation evolves.

4. Stage 4: Resolution  
	Depending on which faction wins, the port will undergo changes:
	- Authorities Win : A stronger presence of law enforcement at Vygor Port, tighter security, and increased taxes or patrols. Players helping the authorities are 
rewarded with reputation and bounties from the kingdom.
	- Smugglers Win : A rise in underground trade and illicit goods circulating freely in Vygor Port. More illegal activities become available for smuggler-aligned 
players, who can now gain access to rare or outlawed goods. Smuggler players gain reputation and rewards from their connections.
	- Neutral Outcome : If both sides reach a standstill, there could be a temporary power vacuum in the port, with new opportunities for rival smugglers or 
undercover authorities to rise.

		Rewards and Consequences :

	For Authorities :
- Reputation Boost : Winning players will earn kingdom reputation, unlock special law enforcement tasks, and gain access to exclusive goods from the kingdom’s 
trusted vendors.

items, underground contacts, and illicit goods.
- Illegal Goods : Smugglers who succeed in escaping with their goods can sell them on the black market for a hefty profit, with unique rare items as rewards.

from rival smugglers.
